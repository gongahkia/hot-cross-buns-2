# Release Candidate Checklist - Mac v1

Date: 2026-05-23
Result: Not release-ready.

## Summary

Automated unit, typecheck, production build, Electron smoke, performance smoke, macOS packaging, checksum verification, and DMG mount smoke completed on 2026-05-23. The Mac runtime now has BYO Google Desktop OAuth setup, macOS Keychain-backed Google/MCP secret storage, authenticated Google transport construction, deferred sync scheduling, live MCP listener lifecycle wiring, and stable DMG/zip preview aliases. The RC is still not public-release ready because live Google account QA, external MCP client QA, signed/notarized distribution, and clean-machine native-shell verification remain manual blockers.

Packaging caveats: `electron-builder` skipped signing because `mac.identity: null`, warned that arm64 requires signing, and generated blockmap/latest metadata that must not be uploaded for the unsigned preview flow. The macOS package uses `build/icon.icns` generated from the round bun app icon on a white rounded background, and package metadata now includes author `gongahkia`.

## Performance Smoke

Mode: report-only. Fixture data was generated locally and used a temporary app data path.

| Flow | Target | Cold | Warm | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Shell visible | cold <1500ms, warm <700ms | 435ms | 256ms | PASS |
| Cached data rendered | <300ms after database open | 486ms total / 375ms after DB | 339ms total / 289ms after DB | WATCH |
| Command palette open | <100ms | 17.79ms | 19.42ms | PASS |
| Quick capture open | <150ms | 49.61ms | 48.5ms | PASS |
| Local search service | <100ms | 14.9ms | 3.5ms | PASS |
| Search UI update | <100ms user-perceived | 38.97ms | 34.07ms | PASS |
| Task scrolling | 16ms target, 32ms sustained max | 25.6ms | 14.11ms | PASS |
| Calendar month navigation | reviewed against frame budget | 37.6ms | 40.59ms | WATCH |
| Task completion optimistic feedback | <100ms | 69.86ms | 53.16ms | PASS |

SQLite query plans were indexed for task, event, note, search, checkpoint, and pending-mutation paths. The final perf run rebuilt the local `better-sqlite3` module for Electron ABI 130 before launch, so app IPC routes used native SQLite (`settings.get` ~0.1ms, task list reads ~1ms, calendar range reads ~2-3ms, local search ~3ms). Node-side direct SQLite measurements in that same run used the Python compatibility fallback because Node ABI 141 could no longer load the Electron binary; those direct measurements are not the app runtime budget.

SQLite adapter follow-up on 2026-05-22: the direct medium-fixture data path moved from the Python bridge to the native adapter and improved materially (`fixtures.seed-medium-sqlite` 2768.22ms -> 81.65ms, `sqlite.task-lists.medium` 275.86ms -> 0.9ms, `search.medium-local` 277.82ms -> 3.58ms). The adapter now lazy-loads `better-sqlite3`, so ABI mismatches are contained by the compatibility layer instead of crashing module import.

Search DSL follow-up on 2026-05-23: the local structured parser/filter slice remains local-only, the renderer debounce was tightened for interactive search, and the Electron Search UI measurement now meets the <100ms user-perceived budget.

## PRD Success Criteria

| Criterion | RC status | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| User can connect Google through desktop OAuth. | IMPLEMENTED for macOS preview code path: Settings accepts BYO Desktop client ID/optional secret, opens PKCE loopback OAuth, stores tokens in Keychain, and returns sanitized status. Live account QA remains required. | Google Sync / Settings |
| User can view selected task lists and calendars from local cache after sync. | PARTIAL: authenticated transport construction and scheduler are wired; live account sync QA and resource-selection polish remain. | Google Sync / Local Data |
| User can create, edit, complete/reopen, move, and delete tasks. | WIRED: local optimistic SQLite flows, authenticated Google write transports, and mutation worker reconciliation are enabled by default; live account QA still required before release signoff. | Core UI / Sync |
| User can create, edit, and delete calendar events. | WIRED: local optimistic SQLite flows, authenticated Google write transports, and mutation worker reconciliation are enabled by default; live account QA still required before release signoff. | Core UI / Sync |
| User can create and search task-backed notes. | IMPLEMENTED. | Core UI / Local Data |
| User can open command palette and quick capture without leaving the keyboard. | IMPLEMENTED for in-app keyboard path; global hotkey path still needs manual verification. | Renderer / Native Shell |
| Tray/menu bar and global hotkey flows work on macOS. | BLOCKED pending installed-app manual verification; code paths exist. | Native Shell |
| Local MCP read tools work behind bearer-token authentication. | IMPLEMENTED in code: live listener starts after the shell is interactive when enabled, binds loopback only, and uses Keychain-backed bearer token storage. External MCP client QA remains required. | MCP / Native Shell |
| MCP write tools support dry-run and confirmation. | IMPLEMENTED in code through the live server and existing tool registry; external MCP client QA remains required. | MCP |
| Tests cover domain logic, SQLite migrations, IPC contracts, Google transport mocks, MCP contracts, and launch smoke flows. | IMPLEMENTED for current covered surfaces. | QA |

## Blockers

| Owner | Blocker | Required resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Google Sync / Settings | Runtime OAuth/Keychain/transport wiring is implemented but not live-account verified. | User-owned live Google QA: connect BYO Desktop client, run manual/balanced sync, create/update/delete tasks/events, verify auth-pause behavior. |
| Sync / Data | Conflict recovery UX and account identity display remain basic. | Add user-facing conflict recovery and improve connected-account display after live OAuth scope behavior is confirmed. |
| MCP / Native Shell | Live MCP listener is wired but not external-client verified. | User-owned MCP QA: enable server, retrieve/configure token through support path, verify read/write tools and confirmation behavior from a real MCP client. |
| Performance / Main / Renderer | Shell startup, task feedback, and Search UI now pass local report-only smoke when the local native module is rebuilt for Electron ABI; cold cached-render-after-DB is still slightly above the soft target. | Keep cold cached render and calendar month navigation on watch, and preserve the Electron-ABI perf step so Python fallback regressions are visible. |
| Data Runtime / Packaging | Native SQLite is primary and package config unpacks `better_sqlite3.node`; clean packaged native-adapter verification remains required. | Run packaged preview smoke on a clean profile and verify no Python compatibility fallback is used. |
| Native Shell / Release QA | Tray/menu bar, global hotkey, notifications, and `hotcrossbuns://` protocol behavior were not manually verified on the packaged app. | Run `docs/testing/manual-macos-native-shell.md` against the packaged app and record results. |
| Release Packaging | Unsigned preview artifacts build and package author metadata is present, but the app remains ad-hoc signed, unsigned for distribution, and not notarization-ready. | Add Developer ID signing, hardened runtime, notarization, and clean-machine Gatekeeper verification before broad distribution. |

## Diff Audit

Git diff audit covered the current tracked changes and the packaging/bundle-review changes observed at the start of QA:

- No accidental secret exposure found in the diff.
- No old Swift/Xcode runtime dependency found.
- No renderer privilege leak found; renderer source remains covered by static boundary tests and bundle review.
- No unrelated churn identified.

Docs updated during this QA pass:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: added install/typecheck/unit-test CI, macOS Electron smoke, scheduled/manual performance smoke, concurrency cancellation, pinned pnpm, and failure artifact uploads.
- `.gitignore`: anchored generated release artifacts as `/release/` so `docs/release/` reports are not ignored.
- `package.json`: added author metadata used by the macOS package.
- `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `docs/agents/workflow.md`: documented contributor setup, pinned pnpm, daily commands, release commands, CI expectations, and release-polish workflow entry points.
- `scripts/install-mac-preview.sh`: added checksum-verifying unsigned preview install helper.
- `docs/support/mac-preview-support.md`: added unsigned install, Gatekeeper, privacy, diagnostics/support, and rollback guidance.
- `docs/security/privacy-and-threat-model.md`: added a short preview support privacy summary.
- `docs/performance/build-and-test-performance.md` and `docs/testing/qa-plan.md`: documented current CI smoke/performance artifact behavior.
- `docs/improvements/05-general-parity-and-release-polish.md`: recorded implemented CI, install helper, contributor, support, and release metadata polish.
- `src/renderer/src/renderer-boundary.test.ts`: allowed the pure `@shared/search` parser namespace while keeping renderer privileged-import assertions intact.
- `assets/brand/` and `build/icon.icns`: copied legacy logo/icon assets and generated the macOS package icon from the round bun mark on a white rounded background.
- `electron-builder.yml`: wired the macOS package icon and copied brand assets into packaged resources.
- `electron-builder.yml`: externalizes and rebuilds the packaged `better-sqlite3` native module, with `better_sqlite3.node` unpacked from ASAR.
- `electron.vite.config.ts` and `scripts/review-bundle.ts`: keep the native SQLite dependency external while allowing the documented main-process native require.
- `src/main/data/sqliteConnection.ts`: replaced the primary Python SQLite bridge with a `better-sqlite3` adapter, production pragmas, prepared statement caching, and a Python compatibility fallback for native ABI mismatch.
- `src/main/data/sqliteConnection.test.ts`: added pragma, reopen, migration, FTS, prepared-statement, rollback, and package-compatibility coverage.
- `src/main/index.ts`: applies the copied app icon to the Electron browser window.
- `src/main/native/electronMacAdapter.ts`: uses the copied menu bar icon/app icon assets and exposes left-click panel plus right-click utility menu behavior.
- `src/main/native/service.ts`: provides menu-bar agenda snapshots from cached tasks/events.
- `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`: uses the copied app icon in the sidebar header.
- `docs/design/design-system.md`: records the copied asset locations and usage.
- `docs/release/distribution.md`: clarified generated `app-update.yml` does not mean updater support.
- `docs/specs/native-parity.md`: documented current Keychain/MCP listener blockers.
- `docs/release/release-candidate-checklist.md`: added this RC report.
