# Hot Cross Buns 2 MCP

Hot Cross Buns 2 can expose a local Model Context Protocol endpoint for agent clients that you explicitly configure on this Mac.

## Enable

1. Open Hot Cross Buns 2 Settings.
2. Go to General -> Agent access.
3. Turn on Local MCP server.
4. Choose a permission mode.
5. Copy the client config and paste it into your MCP client.

The endpoint is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp
```

Requests must include:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <generated-token>
```

The token is stored in the macOS Keychain. Reset it from Settings if a client config is no longer trusted.

## Permissions

- Read-only: clients can search and read tasks, notes, events, lists, and calendars.
- Confirm writes: clients must dry-run a write and pass back the returned `confirmationId` before it applies.
- Allow writes: non-destructive writes can apply directly; delete tools still require dry-run confirmation.

Every write tool accepts `dryRun`. Dry-runs return the planned item payload without changing local state or Google-backed data.

## Tools

Read tools:

- `hcb_doctor`
- `hcb_status`
- `hcb_log`
- `hcb_diff`
- `hcb_show`
- `hcb_search`
- `hcb_today`
- `hcb_week`
- `hcb_get_task`
- `hcb_get_event`
- `hcb_get_note`
- `hcb_list_task_lists`
- `hcb_list_note_lists`
- `hcb_list_calendars`

Write tools:

- `hcb_create_task`
- `hcb_create_note`
- `hcb_create_event`
- `hcb_create_task_list`
- `hcb_create_note_list`
- `hcb_update_task`
- `hcb_update_event`
- `hcb_complete_task`
- `hcb_reopen_task`
- `hcb_move_task`
- `hcb_delete_task`
- `hcb_delete_event`

Tool responses include `applied`, `dryRun`, `requiresConfirmation`, optional `confirmationId`, `message`, and sanitized `item` or `items`. Task and event responses include `hotcrossbuns://` deep links for review in the app.

## Privacy

The MCP server binds only to `127.0.0.1`. It rejects non-local connections and unexpected browser origins. It does not return Google OAuth tokens, cache encryption keys, Keychain material, raw credential config, or raw Google diagnostic payloads.

Write attempts are recorded in the encrypted mutation audit log with the MCP client, tool name, outcome, and argument keys only. The audit metadata intentionally excludes task titles, notes, event details, bearer tokens, and full tool arguments. Settings also shows current server status and recent MCP activity for the current launch.

The HTTP boundary caps request headers and JSON-RPC bodies, rejects malformed duplicate headers and trailing request bytes, compares bearer tokens without early-exit string comparison, and rate-limits requests per local client connection.

## Manual abuse smoke tests

With the app running and Local MCP server enabled, copy the bearer token from Settings -> Agent access and run:

```sh
HCB_MCP_TOKEN='<copied-token>' scripts/mcp-abuse-smoke.sh
```

Set `HCB_MCP_URL` if the port is not the default `8765`. The script uses real `curl` requests against the running app and checks authorized JSON-RPC, unauthorized tokens, rejected origins, malformed JSON, dry-run write behavior, and oversized body rejection. To exercise the rate limiter with a burst of real requests:

```sh
HCB_MCP_TOKEN='<copied-token>' HCB_MCP_RUN_RATE_LIMIT=1 scripts/mcp-abuse-smoke.sh
```

For an interactive MCP-client pass, connect a real HTTP MCP client to the copied Settings config, call `tools/list`, run one read tool, run one write tool with `dryRun: true`, and confirm the Settings activity list plus the Diagnostics audit log show the client/tool/outcome without raw argument values.

## OpenClaw-style setup

Use the copied Settings config when your client accepts HTTP MCP servers. For clients that manage MCP entries by command, configure the URL as:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp
```

and add the copied `Authorization` header. Keep Hot Cross Buns 2 running while the client connects.

## Transport notes

This v1 implements simple Streamable HTTP-style JSON-RPC request/response over `POST /mcp`. It returns `405 Method Not Allowed` for `GET`; SSE and server-initiated streaming are not implemented yet.
