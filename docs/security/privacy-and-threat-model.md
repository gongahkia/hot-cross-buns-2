# Privacy And Threat Model

## Security Posture

Hot Cross Buns 2 is a local-first desktop app that syncs with Google Tasks and Google Calendar. It must protect Google credentials, local personal planning data, and MCP write access.

The app ships with no third-party analytics SDK and no cloud crash reporter by default.

## Sensitive Assets

Sensitive assets include:

- Google refresh tokens
- Google access tokens
- OAuth client secrets supplied by the user
- MCP bearer token
- cache encryption keys if added later
- task notes/details
- calendar event descriptions, locations, guests
- local note bodies
- diagnostics that could reveal account or filesystem metadata

## Storage Rules

- Google tokens live in OS credential storage, not SQLite.
- MCP bearer token lives in OS credential storage, not SQLite.
- SQLite may store mirrored personal data but not credentials.
- Logs and diagnostics must redact secrets by default.
- Renderer storage must not contain credentials or raw Google responses.

## Electron Hardening

Required BrowserWindow defaults:

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `sandbox: true` unless a documented blocker exists
- preload exposes only the typed app API
- navigation blocked except approved external links opened through shell adapter
- new-window handling locked down
- Content Security Policy defined in production

Final release-packaging decisions:

- Production CSP is injected from the main process as a response header. It uses `default-src 'none'`, `script-src 'self'`, `connect-src 'none'`, blocks frames/forms/objects, and allows `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` only for renderer-owned dynamic layout styles.
- Development CSP keeps localhost HTTP/WebSocket connections for Vite only; production does not allow renderer network connections.
- Production file navigation is limited to the loaded app document, ignoring hash changes. Development navigation is limited to the configured local dev-server origin.
- New windows are always denied. Approved external URLs are opened through the shell adapter only for the explicit allowlist: Google OAuth/API help hosts and `mailto:`.
- Renderer source is covered by a static privilege-boundary test that rejects imports from Electron, Node built-ins, main/preload aliases, SQLite, network listener modules, and command-execution modules.

Renderer dependencies must be treated as untrusted relative to local secrets.

## IPC Threats

Primary risks:

- renderer compromise calls privileged APIs
- malformed IPC payload causes unsafe service behavior
- error payload leaks secrets
- direct SQL or filesystem access slips into renderer

Controls:

- runtime validation for every preload API
- allowlisted IPC methods
- parameterized SQL only
- sanitized errors
- tests that renderer cannot import privileged modules
- no broad "execute command" IPC

IPC errors, public error details, diagnostics logs, and performance metadata now pass through shared redaction utilities before they are returned, logged, or persisted.

## MCP Threats

Primary risks:

- local malicious process calls MCP endpoint
- browser page reaches localhost MCP endpoint
- bearer token leaks in logs
- agent performs destructive write accidentally
- oversized/malformed body causes denial of service

Controls:

- bind only to `127.0.0.1`
- require bearer token
- reject unexpected origins
- cap headers and body size
- constant-time token comparison
- rate limiting
- dry-run and confirmation for writes
- destructive writes always require confirmation
- sanitized mutation audit log

Final MCP request limits for release packaging:

- Browser `Origin` headers are rejected entirely. Local MCP clients should omit `Origin`; this prevents browser pages, including localhost pages, from driving the MCP endpoint.
- HTTP headers are capped at 8 KiB and bodies at 256 KiB. Extra trailing bytes, malformed JSON, wrong paths, non-local remotes, and unsupported methods are rejected before tool dispatch.
- The default rate limit is 60 requests per local client key per minute.
- Audit events record client metadata, tool name, outcome, dry-run/confirmation booleans, and redacted argument keys only. Argument values, task/event/note bodies, and bearer tokens are not recorded.

## Google API Threats

Primary risks:

- OAuth token exposure
- overbroad scopes
- logging raw API failures
- confusing sync errors causing data loss

Controls:

- least scopes for Tasks and Calendar only
- token access only in main/worker service
- no raw Google payloads in renderer diagnostics
- retry/backoff for transient failures
- full-resync path for invalid sync tokens
- visible unresolved sync issue state

Google API errors record sanitized kind/status/retry/body-size metadata only. Raw Google error bodies and OAuth token values are not included in renderer status, IPC errors, logs, diagnostics summaries, or performance reports.

## Local Data Threats

Primary risks:

- SQLite database reveals personal data to local users/processes
- migration corrupts cache
- queued mutation applies unexpectedly

Controls:

- store database in app support directory
- migration tests and backups before destructive changes
- mutation queue state visible in diagnostics
- confirmation for destructive data controls
- future-compatible cache encryption design

## Privacy Commitments

- No analytics by default.
- No hosted sync backend in v1.
- No Google Drive access in v1.
- No sharing local notes with Google or MCP clients unless explicitly requested by the user/tool.
- MCP is opt-in and local-only.

Diagnostics and performance reports expose counts, timings, status states, query-plan summaries, and redaction guarantees. They do not include raw Google payloads, OAuth credentials, MCP bearer tokens, local note bodies, task notes, calendar descriptions, guest lists, or full mutation payloads.

## Required Security Tests

- IPC validation rejects malformed inputs.
- Sensitive fields are redacted in errors and diagnostics.
- MCP unauthorized, malformed, oversized, and unexpected-origin requests are rejected.
- OAuth status sent to renderer excludes tokens.
- Logs generated by tests do not contain fake token fixtures.
