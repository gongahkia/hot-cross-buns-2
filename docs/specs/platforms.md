# Platform Strategy

## Scope

Hot Cross Buns 2 starts as a macOS app and must be designed for Windows and Linux expansion. Platform behavior belongs behind adapters so core product logic is shared.

## Platform Priority

1. macOS core app
2. Linux technical preview
3. Windows technical preview

The first implementation should not add Windows/Linux packaging until the macOS core app is useful, but it must avoid Mac-only assumptions in core services.

## Shared Core

Shared across all platforms:

- renderer UI
- domain types
- SQLite repositories
- Google sync
- MCP tools
- preload API shapes
- IPC validation
- command palette command model
- settings model
- test helpers

## Platform Adapters

Create adapter interfaces for:

- app paths
- Keychain/credential storage
- tray/menu bar
- app menu
- global shortcuts
- notifications
- deep links/custom protocol
- autostart/open-at-login
- updater/check-for-update UX
- installer metadata
- diagnostics collection
- platform capability detection

The renderer should not branch directly on platform except for display text and minor interaction conventions.
Native capability state is exposed through the typed preload bridge as `native.capabilities()`. The response includes a `capabilityReport` with redacted path roles, support flags, per-capability status, and diagnostics. Diagnostics summaries include the same native report for copy/export flows.

## macOS V1

Required:

- main app window
- menu bar/tray icon
- app menu with standard edit shortcuts
- global quick capture shortcut
- local notifications
- custom protocol links
- Keychain token storage
- Application Support path for app data
- preview DMG or zip distribution

Deferred:

- Spotlight indexing
- App Intents/App Shortcuts
- Share Extension
- signed/notarized release flow

## Linux AppImage Technical Preview

Implemented scaffold:

- Secret Service/libsecret credential storage through Electron safeStorage,
  with plaintext fallback rejected
- capability-driven diagnostics for tray, global shortcuts, notifications,
  deep links, autostart, updater checks, OAuth loopback, and MCP loopback
- AppImage package target
- desktop file metadata and icon/window association
- Linux AppImage release scripts, checksum generation, AppImage smoke, and
  manual GitHub Actions validation workflow
- update checks through GitHub Releases, without in-place auto-update

Required before public Linux preview:

- Ubuntu LTS GNOME AppImage launch from terminal and file manager
- icon/window grouping verification
- OAuth browser round trip
- Secret Service ready, locked, and missing-state checks
- live MCP localhost smoke
- confirmation that notifications, global shortcuts, tray/status area,
  `hotcrossbuns://`, autostart, and in-place updates remain explicitly
  unsupported unless separately implemented and manually QA'd
- supported distro/desktop matrix notes

Linux support should start with a documented supported-distro matrix rather than claiming universal parity.

See [Linux Port](../ports/linux-port.md).

## Windows Technical Preview

Implemented scaffold:

- Windows safeStorage-backed credential storage adapter
- notification-area tray behavior
- global shortcut registration and conflict handling
- NSIS installer target
- early AppUserModelID setup
- custom protocol registration and argv/`second-instance` routing
- Windows notification scheduling
- GitHub release check for Windows installer assets

Required before public Windows preview:

- Windows 11 x64 NSIS packaging and artifact smoke
- installed-app launch from installer, Start Menu, and desktop shortcut
- SQLite, OAuth, MCP, tray, shortcuts, notifications, deep links, autostart,
  and uninstall manual QA
- code signing/SmartScreen plan

Windows must use the same SQLite schema and Google sync services.

See [Windows Port](../ports/windows-port.md).

## Shared Porting Reference

See [Cross-Platform Porting](../ports/cross-platform-porting.md) for adapter contracts, capability-first UI behavior, and cross-platform test gates.

## Testing Matrix

Before broad release:

- macOS: full test and smoke suite
- Linux: unit, IPC, SQLite, Google mock, launch smoke, tray/hotkey caveat pass
- Windows: unit, IPC, SQLite, Google mock, launch smoke, tray/hotkey manual pass
