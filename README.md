> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preview downloads are not final public distribution builds. macOS currently ships as an unsigned DMG and may require `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway` on first launch. Linux currently ships only as an AppImage technical preview with no in-place auto-update; tray/status-area surfaces, deep links, and autostart are intentionally unsupported.

## Highlights

Hot Cross Buns 2 is an Electron-first desktop planner built around three everyday surfaces:

- Tasks for inbox capture and day-to-day execution, synced with Google Tasks
- Calendar views for agenda, day, week, multi-day, month, year, and longer-range planning, synced with Google Calendar
- Notes backed by task data for context, drafts, and reference material

Around those core surfaces, the app also includes:

- Command palette capture and keyboard-first navigation
- Account workspaces for multiple Google accounts
- Smart rescheduling, task/event/note conversion, reminders, recurrence, templates, and saved views
- Native shell surfaces where supported, including macOS menu bar panels for glanceable calendar, compact capture, and fast return to the main app
- Local customization with CSS snippets, keymaps, extension panels, custom backgrounds, and inferred color themes
- Portable `.hcbexport` archives, local attachments, ICS import/subscription support, and local report exports
- Optional local MCP server, CLI, webhook, and dry-run/write-policy surfaces for user-configured agent clients
- Typed IPC, hardened preload bridge, diagnostics, recovery tools, and native capability reporting

## Install

**Preview downloads**

- macOS DMG: `https://github.com/gongahkia/hot-cross-buns-2/releases/latest/download/Hot-Cross-Buns-2-macOS.dmg`
- Linux AppImage technical preview: `https://github.com/gongahkia/hot-cross-buns-2/releases/latest/download/Hot-Cross-Buns-2-linux-x64.AppImage`
- Release page: `https://github.com/gongahkia/hot-cross-buns-2/releases/latest`
- macOS one-line installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gongahkia.github.io/hot-cross-buns-2/install-macos-preview.sh | bash
```

**First launch on macOS**

1. Open the app once after dragging it into `Applications`.
2. If macOS blocks it, go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security`.
3. Click `Open Anyway`.

You should only need to do that once per Mac.

**First launch on Linux**

The Linux package is an AppImage technical preview. It is intended first for Ubuntu LTS on GNOME, with secondary manual checks on Fedora GNOME, KDE Plasma, Wayland, and X11 before broader claims.

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/gongahkia/hot-cross-buns-2/releases/latest/download/Hot-Cross-Buns-2-linux-x64.AppImage
curl -LO https://github.com/gongahkia/hot-cross-buns-2/releases/latest/download/SHASUMS256.txt
sha256sum -c SHASUMS256.txt --ignore-missing
chmod +x Hot-Cross-Buns-2-linux-x64.AppImage
./Hot-Cross-Buns-2-linux-x64.AppImage
```

Known Linux preview limits:

- AppImage is the only Linux package format.
- The app can check GitHub Releases for newer AppImage builds, but does not download or install Linux updates automatically.
- Tray/status-area surfaces, `hotcrossbuns://` deep links, and open-at-login/autostart are unsupported.
- Notifications and global shortcuts are capability-gated and still require live desktop-environment validation before release.
- Google OAuth tokens, OAuth client secrets, and MCP bearer tokens require an OS-backed Secret Service provider such as GNOME Keyring/libsecret or KWallet. Plaintext fallback is rejected.

**Google Cloud OAuth setup**

Preview downloads use a bring-your-own Google Cloud Desktop OAuth client:

1. Create a Google Cloud project.
2. Enable the Google Tasks API and Google Calendar API.
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen. For personal use, add your Google account as a test user while setting up.
4. Create a `Desktop app` OAuth client.
5. Open Hot Cross Buns 2, paste the desktop client ID and optional client secret into setup, then connect Google.

Tokens are stored in macOS Keychain on macOS. On Linux technical preview builds, tokens are stored through Electron `safeStorage` only when backed by an OS credential provider such as GNOME Keyring/libsecret or KWallet.

Do not distribute a build that embeds your personal OAuth client for other people's accounts.

Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) before changing product, architecture, security, or subsystem behavior.

## Local Development

**Requirements**

- macOS 14+
- Linux AppImage technical preview: Ubuntu LTS on GNOME first, Secret Service provider required for credentials
- Node 20+
- pnpm 9.15.4 through Corepack

**Install and run**

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.15.4 --activate
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

**Useful commands**

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:smoke
pnpm hcb --help
```

## Preview Release Checks

Preview packages are unsigned. macOS preview packages are also unnotarized. They are not final public distribution builds.

```bash
pnpm release:mac:preview
pnpm release:linux:preview
pnpm release:smoke-appimage
HCB_APPIMAGE_SMOKE_LAUNCH=1 pnpm release:smoke-appimage
```

Useful docs:

- [Distribution](docs/release/distribution.md)
- [Release Candidate Checklist](docs/release/release-candidate-checklist.md)
- [Mac Preview Support](docs/support/mac-preview-support.md)
- [Linux Preview Support](docs/support/linux-preview-support.md)
- [Manual Linux Native Shell Checklist](docs/testing/manual-linux-native-shell.md)
- [Privacy and Threat Model](docs/security/privacy-and-threat-model.md)

## Testing

The current suite covers:

- typed IPC contract validation
- SQLite repository and domain-service behavior
- Google Tasks and Google Calendar sync paths
- local search, semantic search, tags, templates, and automation flows
- renderer workflows for Tasks, Calendar, Notes, Settings, command palette, and onboarding
- native shell adapter contracts and release-support paths
- smoke, perf, and release-artifact scripts

Run focused tests with:

```bash
pnpm vitest run --config vitest.config.ts path/to/test.ts
```
