# TODO: Linux Port Technical Preview

This document is the implementation handoff for porting Hot Cross Buns 2 from
macOS-only preview support to a Linux technical preview without deprecating,
weakening, or renaming the existing macOS support.

The first committed pass is documentation-only. Do not add runtime Linux support
claims until the implementation phases and release gates below are complete.

## Current Decisions

- First Linux target: Ubuntu LTS on GNOME.
- First package target: AppImage technical preview.
- Secondary manual checks: Fedora Workstation GNOME, KDE Plasma, one Wayland
  session, and one X11 session.
- Linux credential backend: Electron `safeStorage` through a maintained
  `SecretStore` abstraction, enabled only for OS-backed providers such as
  `gnome_libsecret`, `kwallet`, `kwallet5`, or `kwallet6`. Electron
  `basic_text` plaintext fallback is rejected. `keytar` was rejected as
  unsuitable because its upstream repository is archived and its prebuilt
  Electron support is stale for this repo's Electron 33 runtime.
- Linux update policy: check for GitHub Releases only. Do not claim in-place
  Linux auto-update for the technical preview.
- Tray, global shortcuts, notifications, deep links, and autostart must be
  capability-driven. Unsupported or unverified Linux behavior must remain
  recoverable and visible in diagnostics.

## Current Repo State

- The app is an Electron, Vite, React, TypeScript, and SQLite desktop app.
- `electron-builder.yml` defines macOS DMG/zip packaging and a Linux AppImage
  technical preview target. Linux protocol metadata remains omitted until the
  deep-link release gate is validated.
- `package.json` keeps the existing macOS release scripts and also defines
  Linux preview scripts:
  - `build:release:mac`
  - `build:release:linux`
  - `pack:mac:preview`
  - `pack:linux:preview`
  - `release:mac:preview`
  - `release:linux:preview`
  - `release:linux-artifacts`
  - `release:smoke-dmg`
  - `release:smoke-appimage`
- `src/main/index.ts` selects native behavior through `createNativeAdapter()`.
  Linux startup uses `electron-linux-preview` and does not instantiate
  mac-specific native code.
- `NativePlatformAdapter` in `src/main/native/types.ts` is the correct boundary
  for Linux-specific native behavior.
- Linux local notification scheduling is implemented behind
  `Notification.isSupported()`. Linux notification permission state remains
  non-queryable, and display failures are surfaced as sanitized native
  diagnostics without interrupting sync, tasks, or calendar state.
- Linux global shortcut registration is adapter-gated: X11 sessions can attempt
  Electron `globalShortcut` registration directly, while Wayland sessions require
  Electron's `GlobalShortcutsPortal` feature switch and the XDG Desktop Portal
  GlobalShortcuts interface before registration is attempted.
- Linux tray/status-area support is explicitly unsupported in the technical
  preview until GNOME and KDE status-icon behavior is manually validated. The
  main window remains the supported Linux control surface.
- Linux `hotcrossbuns://` registration is explicitly unsupported until installed
  AppImage desktop integration is validated. Linux AppImage metadata
  intentionally omits the scheme.
- Linux open-at-login/autostart is explicitly unsupported in the technical
  preview. The adapter does not create or remove user-level autostart
  `.desktop` entries.
- Linux update checks use the shared GitHub Releases check-for-new-version flow
  and prefer AppImage assets. No Linux update is downloaded or installed
  automatically.
- `createNoopNativeAdapter()` already reports unsupported Linux behavior without
  claiming support and should remain the unsupported-platform contract fixture.
- `MacOsKeychainSecretStore` and `LinuxSecretServiceStore` are the OS-backed
  `SecretStore` implementations. Other platforms fall back to
  `UnsupportedSecretStore`.
- Google OAuth tokens, the optional OAuth client secret, and the MCP bearer token
  already flow through `SecretStore` abstractions, so Linux credential work
  should extend that abstraction rather than inventing a new credential path.
- Existing porting docs already live under `docs/ports/`, especially:
  - `docs/ports/linux-port.md`
  - `docs/ports/platform-adapter-audit.md`
  - `docs/ports/cross-platform-porting.md`

## Non-Negotiables

- Do not remove, rename, or degrade the macOS adapter, macOS Keychain storage,
  DMG/zip packaging, macOS release scripts, or macOS support docs.
- Do not store Google OAuth tokens, OAuth client secrets, MCP bearer tokens, or
  future sensitive material in plaintext as a Linux fallback.
- Do not expose raw tokens, raw Google payloads, absolute local paths, or bearer
  tokens in renderer state, diagnostics, logs, release artifacts, or support
  bundles.
- Do not branch deeply in renderer code on `process.platform`. Renderer behavior
  should use typed preload capability data from the native adapter.
- Do not claim Linux tray, global shortcut, notification, protocol, autostart,
  or updater parity until each feature has automated tests where feasible and
  manual QA on the supported Linux matrix.
- Do not assume GNOME tray/status-icon behavior matches macOS menu bar behavior.
  The app must remain fully usable without a tray icon.

## Phase 1: Non-Claiming Linux Scaffold

Goal: make Linux startup select a Linux-aware adapter that reports honest
capabilities without trying to implement fragile desktop-environment behavior
too early.

Status: Complete as of 2026-06-13 in implementation commit `905210c`. The app
now selects native adapters through an async platform factory, lazy-loads the
macOS adapter only for `darwin`, uses a non-claiming
`electron-linux-preview` adapter for `linux`, and leaves Windows and unknown
platforms on the existing noop adapter. Verification:

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/main/native/adapterContract.test.ts`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`

Implementation tasks:

- Add a native adapter factory, for example
  `src/main/native/createNativeAdapter.ts`, with this selection:
  - `darwin`: existing `createElectronMacNativeAdapter()`
  - `linux`: new Linux preview adapter
  - `win32` and unknown platforms: existing `createNoopNativeAdapter()`
- Update `src/main/index.ts` to use the factory instead of importing the macOS
  adapter directly.
- Add a Linux adapter module, for example
  `src/main/native/electronLinuxAdapter.ts`, plus small helper files under
  `src/main/native/electronLinux/` only as needed.
- Initial Linux adapter behavior:
  - `appPaths()`: map config, data, cache, logs, diagnostics, and temp through
    Electron/app path APIs and verify they respect XDG expectations on Ubuntu.
  - `capabilities()`: report Linux platform, adapter id, package format, path
    roles, and per-feature states.
  - `credentialStorageStatus()`: report `pending` until Phase 2 is implemented.
  - `openExternalUrl()`: use Electron `shell.openExternal()` and return a
    sanitized success/error result.
  - `openPath()`: use Electron `shell.openPath()` and return a sanitized
    success/error result.
  - `collectDiagnostics()`: return an adapter diagnostic result without raw
    paths beyond existing redacted path capabilities.
  - `installAppMenu()`: install a conventional Linux app menu only if simple and
    low-risk; otherwise return unsupported for the first scaffold.
  - `createTray()`, `registerGlobalShortcut()`, `registerProtocolClient()`,
    `scheduleNotification()`, and `setAutostart()`: return unsupported or
    pending until their dedicated phases are complete.
  - `listFontFamilies()`: return an empty normalized list for the scaffold unless
    a low-risk fontconfig query is added with tests.
- Preserve the noop adapter behavior and tests. The Linux adapter is not a
  replacement for noop.

Automated tests:

- Add adapter factory tests for `darwin`, `linux`, `win32`, and unknown platform
  selection. If direct `process.platform` mocking is awkward, extract the
  selection logic into a pure function that accepts a platform argument.
- Add Linux adapter contract tests that validate:
  - `nativeCapabilitiesResponseSchema` accepts the Linux capability response.
  - mac-specific adapter ids are not reported on Linux.
  - unsupported features are recoverable and carry diagnostic messages.
  - `openExternalUrl()` and `openPath()` sanitize failure messages.
- Keep existing macOS native tests passing unchanged.

Acceptance criteria:

- A Linux dev run no longer instantiates `electronMac` adapter code.
- Linux capability reports are schema-valid.
- At Phase 1 completion, Linux still did not claim tray, shortcut,
  notification, protocol, autostart, credential, or updater parity. Phase 2 now
  adds conditional credential support without changing the other unsupported
  native features.
- macOS behavior and macOS tests remain unchanged.

## Phase 2: Linux Credential Storage

Goal: make Google OAuth, optional OAuth client secret storage, and MCP bearer
token storage secure and recoverable on Linux.

Status: Implementation complete as of 2026-06-13. Linux now uses
`LinuxSecretServiceStore` backed by Electron `safeStorage`, persists only
encrypted metadata under the app config path, hashes service/account storage
keys, forces plaintext encryption off, and refuses Electron's `basic_text`
fallback. The implementation reports ready, pending, unsupported, or error
states through Linux native diagnostics and keeps the public `SecretStore`
interface unchanged. Live desktop checks for GNOME Keyring ready, missing, and
locked states remain release gates under Phase 11. Verification:

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/main/credentials/secretStore.test.ts src/main/native/adapterContract.test.ts src/main/services/serviceContainer.test.ts`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`

Implementation tasks:

- Add the chosen Secret Service backend dependency. Default plan is `keytar`.
  Validate native-module compatibility with the repo's Electron version before
  wiring it into production.
- Add a Linux `SecretStore` implementation, for example
  `LinuxSecretServiceStore`, in or near `src/main/credentials/secretStore.ts`.
- Keep the public `SecretStore` interface unchanged unless a stateful status
  check needs an explicit async method.
- Update `defaultSecretStore()` in `src/main/services/serviceContainer.ts`:
  - `darwin`: `MacOsKeychainSecretStore`
  - `linux`: `LinuxSecretServiceStore`
  - other platforms: `UnsupportedSecretStore`
- Define Linux credential states:
  - `ready`: Secret Service is available and read/write/delete smoke succeeds.
  - `disabled` or `unsupported`: no compatible Secret Service provider exists.
  - `error`: service is locked, unavailable, denied by user, or returns an
    unexpected error.
- Ensure missing or locked Secret Service produces actionable messages in native
  diagnostics and Google/MCP setup flows.
- Ensure all token parse failures keep the existing behavior: delete corrupted
  token material and force reconnection instead of returning partial secrets.
- Update package config so any native `keytar` module is rebuilt and unpacked
  correctly for Linux packages.

Manual Linux credential checks:

- Fresh Ubuntu GNOME profile with GNOME Keyring available.
- Profile with Secret Service missing.
- Profile with Secret Service locked before app launch.
- Save OAuth client id and optional client secret.
- Connect Google account, quit app, relaunch, and confirm token persistence.
- Reset MCP bearer token, quit app, relaunch, and confirm revision changes.
- Confirm diagnostics and logs never include raw token or secret values.

Automated tests:

- Unit-test `LinuxSecretServiceStore` with a fake backend for read, write,
  delete, missing service, locked service, and unexpected backend error.
- Service-container tests should assert Linux chooses the Linux store when no
  explicit store is injected.
- Existing `MemorySecretStore` tests must continue to pass.

Acceptance criteria:

- Runtime Google OAuth can be enabled on Linux without plaintext storage.
- MCP bearer tokens persist on Linux without plaintext storage.
- Missing or locked Secret Service blocks credential-dependent features with a
  clear recoverable status, not a crash.

## Phase 3: Linux AppImage Packaging

Goal: produce a signed-status-neutral Linux AppImage preview artifact with
correct desktop metadata and no changes to macOS packaging.

Status: Implementation complete as of 2026-06-13 in commit `7b8c000`. The repo
now has Linux PNG icon assets, a Linux AppImage target in `electron-builder.yml`,
stable AppImage alias generation, an AppImage artifact smoke script, packaging
config coverage, release distribution docs, and Linux preview support docs.
Linux protocol metadata remains intentionally absent until the deep-link phase.

Verification completed:

- `pnpm exec electron-builder --linux AppImage --dir --publish never`
- `pnpm release:linux-artifacts`
- `pnpm release:checksums`
- `(cd release && sha256sum -c SHASUMS256.txt)`
- `pnpm release:smoke-appimage`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts scripts/linux-packaging-config.test.ts`
- `pnpm test` (`60` Vitest files, `464` tests)
- `pnpm build`

Remaining manual release gates: launch the AppImage from terminal and file
manager, run the opt-in isolated launch smoke with
`HCB_APPIMAGE_SMOKE_LAUNCH=1`, confirm icon/window grouping on the supported
desktop matrix, and re-run macOS package smoke on a macOS host before shipping.

Implementation tasks:

- Extend `electron-builder.yml` with a Linux AppImage target:
  - keep the existing macOS config intact
  - add `linux.target: AppImage`
  - set Linux category to a productivity/office category accepted by
    electron-builder and desktop environments
  - provide Linux PNG icon assets in the expected directory layout
  - set desktop metadata for app name, generic name, categories, keywords, icon,
    and `StartupWMClass` where supported
  - include protocol metadata only when Phase 6 validates deep-link behavior
- Do not wrap AppImage output in zip or tar archives.
- Add npm scripts:
  - `build:release:linux`
  - `pack:linux:preview`
  - `release:linux:preview`
  - an AppImage smoke script once the artifact exists
- Extend release artifact helpers only where needed:
  - `scripts/release-checksums.ts` already recognizes `.AppImage`; verify this
    remains true after artifact naming changes.
  - Add a Linux alias helper if stable latest names are desired, for example
    `Hot-Cross-Buns-2-linux-x64.AppImage`.
- Add or update docs:
  - `docs/release/distribution.md` with Linux preview commands and expected
    artifact paths.
  - `docs/support/linux-preview-support.md` with AppImage run, chmod, checksum,
    known limitations, and support diagnostics guidance.
  - README badges/copy only after the Linux preview release gate passes.

Manual package checks:

- Build AppImage on Linux CI or a Linux host.
- Verify `chmod +x Hot-Cross-Buns-2-*.AppImage` launches the app.
- Launch from terminal and file manager.
- Confirm app icon appears.
- Confirm taskbar/window grouping uses the expected name/class.
- Confirm app data lands under expected XDG/Electron directories.
- Confirm uninstall/removal policy is documented.

Automated tests:

- Add a lightweight config test or script that verifies Linux target metadata is
  present without removing macOS targets.
- Add an AppImage smoke script that checks artifact existence, executable bit,
  embedded desktop metadata if feasible, and launch startup logs in a clean temp
  user-data directory.

Acceptance criteria:

- macOS DMG/zip release commands still work.
- Linux AppImage can be produced with electron-builder.
- Checksums cover AppImage artifacts.
- Public docs identify Linux as a technical preview, not broad Linux support.

## Phase 4: Linux Notifications

Goal: support local reminders on Linux only when Electron and the desktop
environment can show notifications.

Status: Implementation complete as of 2026-06-13 in commit `b73b8a6`.
Linux now detects notification support through Electron, schedules reminders
through the main-process `Notification` class, keeps Linux permission query
state unsupported, retains active notifications for click routing, and turns
display failures into sanitized recoverable native status errors.

Verification completed:

- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/main/native/adapterContract.test.ts src/main/native/service.test.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm test` (`60` Vitest files, `468` tests)

Remaining manual release gates: GNOME delivery, KDE delivery, packaged
AppImage click-through that opens/focuses the app and dispatches the intended
action, Settings-disabled notification clearing in a live desktop session, and
diagnostics visibility for real desktop delivery failures.

Implementation tasks:

- Implement Linux notification detection with Electron `Notification.isSupported()`.
- Schedule notifications through Electron's `Notification` class, matching the
  existing `NativeNotificationRequest` contract.
- Treat notification permission query as unsupported unless Electron exposes a
  reliable Linux permission state for the target version.
- If notification creation or display fails, set native status to `error` and
  keep sync/task/calendar behavior unaffected.
- Keep notification content concise and privacy-conscious.

Manual checks:

- GNOME notification delivery.
- KDE notification delivery.
- Notification click opens/focuses the app and dispatches the intended action.
- Notifications disabled in Settings clear scheduled notifications.
- Notification failures are visible in diagnostics and do not crash the app.

Acceptance criteria:

- Linux notifications can be enabled only when supported.
- Unsupported or failed notifications are recoverable.
- Existing macOS notification behavior remains unchanged.

## Phase 5: Linux Global Shortcuts

Goal: support quick capture/global shortcuts where Linux desktop infrastructure
allows it, while treating denial and unsupported sessions as normal outcomes.

Status: Adapter-level implementation complete as of 2026-06-13. Linux startup
enables Electron's `GlobalShortcutsPortal` feature switch before app ready, the
Linux adapter detects X11 versus Wayland with `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, probes XDG
Desktop Portal GlobalShortcuts availability for Wayland sessions, exposes
Wayland/portal diagnostics in the native capability report, attempts
`globalShortcut.register()` only for supported sessions, and returns conflict or
unsupported recovery guidance without crashing. The in-app quick add path
remains available when global registration is unavailable or denied.

Verification completed:

- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/main/native/adapterContract.test.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm test` (`60` Vitest files, `471` tests)

Remaining manual release gates: Ubuntu GNOME Wayland portal registration and
denial, Ubuntu GNOME X11 registration/conflict behavior, KDE Plasma Wayland
behavior, and end-to-end quick-capture dispatch in a packaged AppImage session.

Implementation tasks:

- For X11 sessions, test Electron `globalShortcut` directly.
- For Wayland sessions, gate support behind Chromium/Electron
  `GlobalShortcutsPortal` support and XDG Desktop Portal availability.
- Detect session type with environment signals such as `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, but
  treat it as diagnostic context, not proof that registration will work.
- Add capability fields or diagnostics for:
  - Wayland session detected
  - portal shortcut support detected or missing
  - registration conflict
  - user denial
- If registration fails, keep quick capture available in-app and show recovery
  guidance in Settings/Diagnostics.

Manual checks:

- Ubuntu GNOME Wayland with portal support.
- Ubuntu GNOME X11 where available.
- KDE Plasma Wayland.
- Shortcut conflict with an existing desktop shortcut.
- User denial or missing portal support.

Acceptance criteria:

- No Linux session crashes if a shortcut cannot be registered.
- Linux shortcut status is explicit and actionable.
- The app does not claim global hotkeys are reliable across all Linux desktops.

## Phase 6: Linux Tray And Status Area

Goal: provide optional tray/status-area behavior without making it central to
Linux usability.

Status: Closed as explicitly unsupported as of 2026-06-13. Electron `Tray` is
not enabled on Linux because the required GNOME and KDE status-icon validation
has not been completed. The Linux adapter now reports tray/status-area support
as explicitly unsupported, includes desktop-session context in sanitized
capability diagnostics, and keeps the main window as the supported control
surface. macOS menu-bar behavior remains owned by the macOS adapter.

Verification completed:

- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/main/native/adapterContract.test.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`

Remaining manual release gates: GNOME without status-icon extensions, GNOME with
common appindicator/status-icon support, KDE Plasma status area, and Linux tray
action behavior if a later release decides to enable Electron `Tray`.

Implementation tasks:

- Implement tray with Electron `Tray` only after validating icon behavior on
  GNOME and KDE.
- Prefer a conventional context menu for Linux first. Do not port the macOS
  menu-bar panel assumptions directly unless the behavior is validated.
- Expose tray registration success, failure, and unsupported states through the
  existing native capability report.
- If GNOME hides status icons or requires extensions, report that as a caveat and
  keep the app usable through the main window.

Manual checks:

- GNOME default session without status-icon extensions.
- GNOME with common appindicator/status-icon support if used.
- KDE Plasma status area.
- Show/hide main window.
- Refresh action.
- Open settings.
- Quit.

Acceptance criteria:

- Linux tray is optional.
- Missing tray never blocks startup, sync, notifications, or Google/MCP setup.
- macOS menu bar panel behavior remains intact.

## Phase 7: Linux Custom Protocol And Deep Links

Goal: support `hotcrossbuns://` links after package metadata and desktop
registration are verified.

Status: Closed as explicitly unsupported as of 2026-06-13. Linux
`hotcrossbuns://` registration is not enabled because installed/integrated
AppImage desktop-entry behavior has not been manually verified. The Linux
adapter reports protocol registration as unsupported, AppImage metadata
continues to omit the scheme, the AppImage smoke script enforces that omission,
and the existing parser remains safe for malformed links without exposing raw
paths or tokens.

Verification completed:

- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/main/native/adapterContract.test.ts scripts/linux-packaging-config.test.ts`
- `pnpm release:smoke-appimage`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`

Remaining manual release gates: installed/integrated AppImage warm-start link
routing, cold-start link routing after renderer readiness, malformed-link
handling in the packaged app, and confirmation that Linux desktop integration
does not expose filesystem paths or tokens.

Implementation tasks:

- Keep deep links unsupported in the Linux adapter until AppImage desktop
  integration is validated.
- Add desktop metadata for the custom scheme only when packaging support is
  ready.
- Implement protocol registration/check behavior in the Linux adapter if
  Electron and the installed desktop entry can support it reliably.
- Preserve existing parser behavior in `src/main/native/deepLinks.ts`.
- Add explicit safe handling for malformed links and links to missing local
  resources.

Manual checks:

- Installed/integrated AppImage opens from `hotcrossbuns://` URL.
- Running app receives and routes a deep link.
- Closed app launches and routes a deep link after renderer readiness.
- Malformed links show a safe error.
- Links do not expose filesystem paths or tokens.

Acceptance criteria:

- Deep-link support is package-verified before public docs mention it.
- No malformed link can crash startup or expose sensitive data.

## Phase 8: Linux Autostart

Goal: decide whether open-at-login belongs in the Linux preview after core app,
credentials, packaging, and native shell behavior are stable.

Status: Closed as explicitly unsupported as of 2026-06-13. Linux open-at-login
is not enabled because a user-level autostart `.desktop` entry implementation
has not been validated across desktop environments. The Linux adapter reports
autostart as unsupported, does not write or remove autostart entries, and
Settings/Diagnostics expose the unsupported state.

Verification completed:

- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/main/native/adapterContract.test.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`

Remaining manual release gates: user-level autostart `.desktop` create/remove
behavior, desktop-environment-specific login behavior, and uninstall/removal
policy if a later release enables autostart.

Implementation tasks:

- Keep autostart unsupported for the first Linux preview unless a simple desktop
  entry implementation is validated.
- If implemented, create/remove a user-level autostart `.desktop` entry through
  the platform adapter only.
- Report status and failures in native diagnostics.
- Document desktop-environment limitations.

Acceptance criteria:

- Autostart is optional and never blocks the Linux preview.
- Settings copy does not imply universal Linux support.

## Phase 9: Linux Update Checks

Goal: preserve preview-safe update behavior without package-manager conflicts.

Status: Implementation complete as of 2026-06-13. Release checking now uses a
shared native GitHub Releases helper with platform-specific asset preferences:
macOS prefers DMG then ZIP, while Linux prefers AppImage. Linux exposes manual
GitHub release checks through the native adapter and keeps in-place auto-update
disabled.

Verification completed:

- `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/main/native/githubReleaseUpdates.test.ts src/main/native/adapterContract.test.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`

Remaining manual release gates: confirm Settings check-for-updates opens the
right Linux release asset once a published AppImage release exists, and confirm
release copy does not imply automatic download or install.

Implementation tasks:

- Keep the current check-for-GitHub-release pattern.
- Make download asset selection platform-aware:
  - macOS should prefer DMG/zip as today.
  - Linux should prefer AppImage once release assets exist.
- Do not enable Electron's built-in `autoUpdater` for Linux.
- Do not claim automatic in-place updates for AppImage, DEB, or RPM until a
  package-specific updater decision is made and tested.

Acceptance criteria:

- Linux users can manually discover a newer GitHub Release.
- The app does not download or install Linux updates automatically.
- macOS update-check behavior remains compatible with current preview docs.

## Phase 10: OAuth, MCP, Networking, And Security

Goal: validate that shared network flows work correctly on Linux and remain
locked to local/safe boundaries.

Implementation tasks:

- Verify default browser handoff from Linux through the native adapter's
  external URL opener.
- Verify Google OAuth loopback listener on localhost.
- Verify firewall/security tools do not break the supported Ubuntu GNOME path.
- Verify MCP binds only to `127.0.0.1`.
- Verify MCP rejects non-local or unauthorized requests.
- Verify runtime files are written under Linux config paths and do not contain
  raw bearer tokens.
- Re-run diagnostics redaction tests with Linux path examples.

Manual checks:

- OAuth connect with browser round trip.
- OAuth disconnect and reconnect.
- Token refresh after app restart.
- MCP enabled, disabled, token reset, and external CLI smoke.
- Logs and diagnostics inspected for token/path redaction.

Acceptance criteria:

- OAuth and MCP work on Linux only with OS-backed secret storage.
- No sensitive material appears in renderer IPC, logs, diagnostics, or support
  exports.

## Phase 11: Linux QA Matrix

Required automated gates before any Linux preview release:

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`
- release bundle review
- SQLite migration/repository tests
- IPC contract tests
- MCP contract tests
- Google transport mock tests
- Playwright launch/navigation smoke on Linux
- AppImage smoke script
- performance smoke report on Linux

Required manual Linux checks:

- Ubuntu LTS GNOME AppImage launch from terminal.
- Ubuntu LTS GNOME AppImage launch from file manager.
- AppImage launched with isolated `HCB_USER_DATA_DIR`.
- App icon and taskbar grouping.
- Window open, close, hide/show, and quit.
- OAuth browser round trip.
- Secret Service ready, missing, and locked states.
- MCP localhost smoke.
- Notifications, if implemented.
- Global shortcut on X11, if implemented.
- Global shortcut on Wayland, if implemented.
- Tray behavior on GNOME and KDE, if implemented.
- `hotcrossbuns://` protocol smoke, if implemented.
- Package removal/uninstall data policy documented.

Performance checks:

- AppImage cold launch shell visible.
- Warm launch shell visible.
- Command palette open.
- In-app quick capture open.
- Local search against medium fixture.
- Task list scroll against large fixture.
- Calendar month navigation against large fixture.
- SQLite query-plan report.

## Phase 12: Documentation And Product Copy

Goal: keep user-facing claims accurate.

Implementation tasks:

- Update `docs/ports/linux-port.md` as implementation decisions land.
- Add `docs/testing/manual-linux-native-shell.md`.
- Add `docs/support/linux-preview-support.md`.
- Update `docs/release/distribution.md` with Linux preview build and install
  steps.
- Update README only after Linux preview gates pass:
  - keep macOS download/install instructions
  - add Linux technical preview instructions
  - clearly label AppImage as preview
  - list unsupported Linux native features honestly
- Update public docs site only after the release artifact exists.

Acceptance criteria:

- User-facing docs do not say Linux is generally supported before the preview is
  released.
- Support docs include diagnostics, known limitations, and rollback/removal
  guidance.
