## July 2026 Frontend Reference Prompts

Run these before the platform port prompts. Each visual prompt should be run with screenshots attached in the chat or placed under the suggested local folders:

- `artifacts/reference-screenshots/apple-calendar/`
- `artifacts/reference-screenshots/notion-calendar/`
- `artifacts/reference-screenshots/ticktick/`
- `artifacts/reference-screenshots/hcb-before/`

Use Apple Calendar, Notion Calendar, and TickTick as reference products only. Extract layout, density, navigation, interaction, and performance lessons. Do not copy protected branding, exact icons, exact copy, product names in UI, or proprietary artwork.

### P7A Calendar Reference Screenshot Intake

Run first, before editing renderer UI. Attach or point to Apple Calendar, Notion Calendar, TickTick, and current Hot Cross Buns 2 screenshots.

```text
You are Codex 5.5 running with extra-high reasoning in /Users/gongahkia/Desktop/coding/projects/hot-cross-buns-2.

Goal: turn Apple Calendar, Notion Calendar, TickTick, and current Hot Cross Buns 2 screenshots into a scoped frontend implementation plan.

Screenshot inputs:
- Apple Calendar: artifacts/reference-screenshots/apple-calendar/
- Notion Calendar: artifacts/reference-screenshots/notion-calendar/
- TickTick: artifacts/reference-screenshots/ticktick/
- Current Hot Cross Buns 2 before screenshots: artifacts/reference-screenshots/hcb-before/

Read first:
- docs/README.md
- docs/agents/workflow.md
- docs/design/design-system.md
- docs/specs/core-app.md
- docs/specs/google-sync.md
- docs/performance/renderer-performance.md
- docs/improvements/01-user-facing-feature-parity.md
- docs/improvements/04-test-coverage-parity.md
- docs/improvements/06-frontend-ux-ui-competitive-improvements.md
- src/renderer/src/App.tsx
- src/renderer/src/features/core/CoreScreens.tsx
- src/renderer/src/styles/index.css
- src/renderer/src/components/primitives.tsx

Tasks:
- Inventory each screenshot by product, viewport, surface, and useful UI idea.
- Extract product-agnostic patterns only:
  - Apple Calendar: compact day/week/month density, time grid rhythm, event color treatment, navigation placement, all-day row behavior.
  - Notion Calendar: source visibility, sidebar/context organization, calm visual hierarchy, quick event editing, keyboard-friendly commands.
  - TickTick: task-calendar bridge, scheduled task blocks, due/priority affordances, completion flow, compact filters.
- Compare those patterns with the current Hot Cross Buns 2 renderer.
- Identify a small set of frontend edits that fit the existing React, Tailwind, design-token, typed preload, and local-cache architecture.
- Create or update docs/improvements/07-calendar-reference-frontend-plan.md with:
  - screenshot inventory
  - source-product lesson matrix
  - exact target files
  - implementation order
  - accessibility risks
  - performance risks
  - test and screenshot verification plan

Do not:
- Implement frontend code in this prompt unless the plan file already exists and is obviously stale.
- Copy exact branding, artwork, labels, icons, or layouts.
- Add network calls, privileged renderer access, or filesystem access from the renderer.
- Add a landing page or marketing-style shell.

Acceptance checks:
- The plan names the screenshots actually used.
- The plan separates visual polish, interaction behavior, data/backend needs, tests, and performance work.
- The plan lists blocked items clearly when screenshots are missing.
```

Run after the frontend visual passes, or earlier if calendar navigation remains slow.

```text
You are Codex 5.5 running with extra-high reasoning in /Users/gongahkia/Desktop/coding/projects/hot-cross-buns-2.

- src/renderer/src/features/core/coreViewModels.ts

Implement:
- Run or inspect the latest pnpm test:perf report and identify renderer hot paths.
- Focus first on calendar month navigation, week/day grid rendering, agenda virtualization, task list rendering, search rendering, command palette open time, and expensive derived view-model work.
- Move expensive grouping, sorting, range materialization, and filtering out of render where possible.
- Use stable selectors, memoized derived models, or small focused component boundaries where measurements justify them.
- Keep virtualization for large lists and avoid adding DOM nodes for off-screen data.
- Add or refine renderer timing labels only behind existing profiling gates.
- Add or update focused tests for any behavior touched by performance changes.

Do not:
- Blanket-wrap every component in memo.
- Add new dependencies unless the repo already has a clear pattern for them.

- Commit generated artifacts/perf files unless release docs explicitly require a baseline.

Acceptance checks:
- Run pnpm typecheck.
- Run pnpm test.
- Run pnpm build.

Run after P7F if startup, cached render, or bundle size remains above target.

```text
You are Codex 5.5 running with extra-high reasoning in /Users/gongahkia/Desktop/coding/projects/hot-cross-buns-2.

Implement:
- Review latest startup timing, cached-render timing, and bundle review output.
- Split or lazy-load renderer code only where it clearly reduces initial work without making core planner flows feel delayed.
- Keep command palette, quick capture, sidebar, and current section cheap to mount.
- Avoid loading settings, diagnostics, search-heavy, or inspector-heavy surfaces before they are needed unless current architecture requires it.
- Trim accidental renderer imports, large constants, unused icons, or test-only data from production paths.
- Preserve preload security boundaries and typed IPC contracts.
- Update performance docs if thresholds, measurement notes, or accepted caveats change.

Do not:
- Hide slow work behind arbitrary timeouts.

## Future Platform Prompts

Run these only after Mac v1 is stable. Do not run Linux and Windows port work in parallel for the first pass. Linux is the first non-Mac port; Windows follows after the Linux adapter lessons are incorporated.

### P8A Cross-Platform Adapter Audit

Run alone after Mac v1.

- Add capability-report DTOs exposed through preload/settings where appropriate.
- Add adapter contract tests that can run without Linux or Windows.

- Update docs if the adapter contract changes.

Do not:

Run alone after Linux and Windows technical preview work has landed.

```text
You are Codex 5.5 running with extra-high reasoning in /Users/gongahkia/Desktop/coding/projects/hot-cross-buns-2.
