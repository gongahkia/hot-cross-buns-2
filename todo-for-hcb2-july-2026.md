# TODO for HCB2 - July 2026

Consolidated from:

- `stuff-missing-from-hcb2-to-add-july-2026.md`
- `prompts-to-run-july-2026-to-port-to-diff-devices.md`
- `proposed-optimisations-for-hcb2-july-2026.md`

This is the single July 2026 planning todo. Ports stay last.

Last repo audit for this file: 2026-06-09.

Audit note: static repo/source/test evidence only. No live Google API, external MCP client, packaged-app, or manual UI QA was performed for this update. Follow-up removed verified implemented leftovers for snooze UX, auto-tag audit/reapply, calendar drag-create, note-template creation, pointer repair, and dock badge code paths.

Status key:

- `Done`: static repo evidence found.
- `Partial`: implemented enough to use, but named hardening/depth remains.
- `Missing`: no static repo evidence found during this audit.
- `Verify`: likely present or adjacent code exists, but needs a feature-specific audit before code.
- `Deferred`: intentionally parked.

## Current status snapshot

### Done / verified present

- Task-backed notes are the current app/MCP/CLI model. Old local-only SQLite note tables are dropped by migration evidence, and docs/specs say notes sync through Google Tasks.
- MCP/CLI v1 exists with Git-like reads and writes:
  - reads: `doctor`, `status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `search`, `today`, `week`, list/get commands, undo status, pending mutations
  - writes: sync/retry/cancel queue, create/update/delete task/event/note/list, rename lists, complete/reopen task/event, move task, schedule task block, settings/OAuth/MCP admin, undo/redo, convert
  - dry-run/confirmation behavior exists for writes, destructive tools are guarded, and CLI docs exist.
- CRUD coverage for tasks, events, notes, task lists, and note lists exists through the shared domain services used by UI and MCP/CLI.
- Event completion exists as local HCB state for calendar events, including renderer behavior and MCP/CLI complete/reopen tools.
- Convert flows exist for task/event/note primitives; birthdays are explicitly excluded from conversion.
- Duplicate controls exist for task/event/note/birthday inspector flows; copies use `(copy)` naming and open as editable drafts.
- Birthday events are first-class HCB calendar events with `hcbKind: "birthday"`, strict UI fields, Google `eventType`/birthday metadata read mapping, strict birthday create/update payload tests, and birthday-safe mutation worker handling.
- Google Calendar event `colorId` is cached, written, theme-mapped, and user-overridable in Appearance settings.
- Rule-based auto-tagging/color assignment exists for tasks/events/notes with settings toggle, validation, preview, conflict visibility, reorder controls, invalid-regex auto-disable, and tests.
- Calendar has Agenda/Day/Multi-Day/Week/Month modes, overflow popovers titled `Items for <date>`, all-item overflow contents, completed-first ordering in overflow, and task-linked Google Calendar projection cleanup on task deletion.
- Startup bootstrap snapshot, light bootstrap timings, startup fan-out fallback, and deferred `calendar.scheduleSuggest` request path exist.
- Near-immediate post-CRUD sync/drain path exists through shared sync control/service-container wiring and live Google smoke docs reference `sync.post-crud-drain`.
- Advanced local search parser/repository coverage exists for regex, attendee, duration, notes/body presence, due/start windows, list, calendar, tag, status, priority, and source/domain filters.
- Local semantic/hybrid search now exists with a deterministic local embedding index for tasks/events/notes, diagnostics metadata, and focused SQLite tests. Production transformer/vector-extension packaging remains open.
- Chat sidebar/provider plumbing now exists with local-disabled fallback, Ollama/OpenAI-compatible provider hooks, remote-endpoint opt-in, local chat history, Settings controls, and focused SQLite tests. Full MCP-client planning/action proposal depth remains open.
- Sync mode selector exists for `manual`, `balanced`, and `near-real-time`, including settings UI, onboarding UI, diagnostics status, scheduler behavior, and tests.
- Past-event and completed-task retention settings exist, including `0` as forever and sync read lower-bound behavior.
- Diagnostics has logs, History, and Sync Issues surfaces with copy/search/error states and command-palette entry points.
- Local backup settings and manual backup action exist.
- MCP resources and prompt registry exist with status/doctor/today/week/diff/logs/pending-mutation resources and sync/today/week/support prompts.
- Durable pending agent action storage, IPC/preload contracts, floating approval tray, approve/reject/expiry states, and MCP dry-run confirmation persistence now exist with focused tests.
- Loopback webhook subscriptions now exist with localhost-only URL validation, HMAC signatures, private-body redaction by default, Settings toggles, task-created/task-completed/sync-completed emits, and focused validation tests.
- Google account disconnected state is surfaced as a user-visible issue while cached SQLite data can still render.
- Sidebar task/note counts use HCB-visible task-backed counts instead of raw Google/cache totals.
- Full unit suite was previously green after the latest auto-tag/settings hardening pass.

### Partial / still worth drilling down

- Tags now have a first-class local catalog, many-to-many entity links, tag CRUD/merge UI, tag colors, bootstrap/IPC/preload/source plumbing, backfill from existing task/event tag JSON, grouped undo for bulk tag writes/merge/delete, and Settings tag analytics.
- Auto-tagging has inspector-level audit detail plus backend full-cache preview/apply reapply for cached tasks/events/notes. Background scheduling and large-account perf QA remain open.
- Multi-account plumbing is partially present: account IDs, account-scoped tokens/cache/checkpoints/mutations, latest-account transport, and multi-account docs/tests exist. Full connected-account management UX, account badges/filters, explicit target account selection, and merged multi-account Today remain open.
- Duplicate detection/review exists for tasks/events/notes with dismiss/open/delete/merge flows. Cleanup now runs through the main domain service with grouped undo and cleanup-group metadata on affected pending mutations; deeper duplicate-resolution QA and stronger mutation compaction remain open.
- Conversion works, but should get one live/manual QA pass against real Google sync for replace-original cleanup and queued mutation replay.
- MCP/CLI is featureful, and prompt/resource registries now include `hcb_brief`, `hcb tail`, `hcb plan`, `hcb://brief`, `hcb://plan`, and `hcb://tail`. Durable pending agent actions and loopback webhooks are now present; external MCP client QA, webhook retry/rate-limit hardening, and full event-source coverage remain open.
- Birthday Google payload shape is unit-tested, but live Google API smoke for birthday create/update/delete is still the main external-risk test.
- Quick-add/NL parsing has meaningful code and tests, including recurrence handling, but not the full chrono-style parser depth listed below.
- Calendar recurrence UI exists. Edit/delete scope selection now reaches repository writes; whole-series, Google-backed occurrence edits/deletes, and locally materialized future-series splits are covered by focused tests. Google-expanded future-series edits still fail fast when the master series is unavailable; deeper RRULE editor depth and live Google smoke remain open.
- Search/filter depth is partial: advanced parser-backed operators, boolean `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`, saved-search settings, pinned filters, command-palette pinned filter chips, opt-in local semantic/hybrid search with disabled lexical fallback diagnostics, provider-backed chat, and a chat sidebar exist. Production semantic model/vector packaging and richer agentic planning remain open.
- Portable data has real `.hcbexport` export/preview/import with deterministic state JSON, selected list/calendar/future filters, manifest SHA-256, attachment bundling/relinking, richer item-level import preview, pre-import backup, local pointer scan/repair UI, and focused tests. ICS import/subscriptions and manual migration QA remain open.

### Missing / not implemented yet

- Hierarchical Areas.
- Bulk reschedule beyond current bulk complete/move/delete, bulk tag, and duplicate undo paths.
- Production semantic vector/model packaging and richer conversational planning/action proposals.
- CSS snippets, JSON config/keymaps, and sandboxed user extensions.
- ICS import/subscriptions.
- Cache encryption.
- Spotlight/Raycast/Alfred/App Intents/Shortcuts/Share Extension.
- Rich notification actions.
- Linux/Windows ports.

## Recommended next implementation order

1. First-class tags:
   - Status: `Partial`; implemented local tag catalog/repository, tag/entity tables, CRUD/merge UI, tag colors, counts, filters via tag search, pinned saved filters, inspector audit, backend full-cache auto-tag reapply, and Settings analytics.
   - Remaining: background scheduling and large-account perf QA.
2. Recurrence correctness:
   - Status: `Partial`; whole-series, Google-backed occurrence edits/deletes, locally materialized future-series splits, and recurrence tests exist.
   - Remaining: Google-expanded future-series writes when master data is unavailable, deeper RRULE editor, and live Google smoke.
   - reason: high-risk calendar behavior; better before broad calendar automation.
3. Boolean/custom search and pinned filters:
   - Status: `Partial`; boolean DSL, pinned saved filters, opt-in local semantic/hybrid search with lexical fallback when disabled, local-disabled chat, Ollama/OpenAI-compatible provider hooks, and a chat sidebar are implemented.
   - Remaining: production transformer/vector-extension path, background embedding worker/model controls, broader embedding coverage, richer provider health/diagnostics, and MCP-backed action proposals.
4. Duplicate merge/coalesced cleanup:
   - Status: `Partial`; duplicate group merge is implemented for loaded tasks/events/notes, with domain-backed cleanup, grouped undo, cleanup-group pending-mutation metadata, and added task QA.
   - Remaining: stronger mutation compaction and deeper event/note duplicate-resolution QA.
5. Portable export/import verification or implementation:
   - Status: `Partial`; deterministic `.hcbexport`, selected list/calendar/future filters, dry-run import diff with item summaries, attachment bundling/relinking, local pointer scan/repair UI, and pre-import backups exist.
   - Remaining: manual migration QA on a real profile copy.
6. Agent-native MCP/CLI v2:
   - Status: `Partial`; `hcb brief`, `hcb tail`, `hcb plan`, `hcb_brief`, `hcb_tail`, `hcb_plan`, resources, prompts, durable pending action storage, approval tray, and loopback webhooks are implemented.
   - Remaining: webhook retry/rate-limit hardening, event-starting/mutation-failed emit sources, external MCP client QA, and deeper approval-tray UI QA.
7. Release hardening:
   - live Google smoke, external MCP client QA, notification actions, updater, packaging/signing checks
   - reason: product-readiness work after feature slices stabilize.

## 0. Planning gate

- 2026-06-08: this file was statically re-audited against the current repo. Repeat before any implementation slice; live/manual QA was not part of this audit.
- Re-audit current repo and `../hot-cross-buns` before implementation.
- For each item below, classify as `Present`, `Partial`, `Missing`, or `Deferred-with-reason` before code.
- Inspect at minimum:
  - `src/main/mcp/toolRegistry.ts`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/inspectors/TaskInspectorBody.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/screens/settings/AdvancedSettingsTab.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/screens/calendar/CalendarEventForm.tsx`
  - `src/main/sync/readSyncRepository/recurrence.ts`
  - `src/main/native/notificationScheduling.ts`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/viewModelSource/loader.ts`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/viewModelSource/provider.tsx`
- Interview user before coding: priorities, acceptable slices, UX expectations, migration tolerance, security expectations, platform scope, test depth, and explicit deferrals.
- Produce a dependency-aware implementation plan with migrations, UI surfaces, IPC/contracts, tests, manual QA, and rollback/data-safety notes.
- Keep each slice scoped; update this todo when an item is implemented, verified present, or deferred.

## 1. Startup and sync optimisations

- Status: `Done`; implemented 2026-06-06 and statically rechecked 2026-06-08.
- Done: defer `calendar.scheduleSuggest` until after first useful render.
  - Initial snapshot should render tasks, calendar, notes, settings, sync status, Google status, and native status without waiting for suggestions.
  - Today/schedule UI needs stable pending and empty states.
  - Update tests that assume startup waits on `scheduleSuggest`.
- Done: add one bootstrap IPC snapshot for initial app load.
  - Replace startup IPC fan-out with one typed bootstrap endpoint where safe.
  - Keep paging and lazy calendar range loading separate.
  - Treat bootstrap contract changes as high blast-radius.
- Done: trigger near-immediate pending-mutation queue drain after CRUD.
  - Debounce and batch drains.
  - Respect offline mode, disconnected accounts, sync-paused state, and app quit/startup sync.

## 2. Core planner feature gaps

### Accounts and sync scope

- Status: `Partial`.
- Static evidence exists for account IDs, account-scoped OAuth token storage, account-scoped cache rows/checkpoints/mutations, latest-account transport selection, and migration/sync replay tests. Product UX and merged multi-account planning remain incomplete.
- Promote the account mirror to first-class multi-account:
  - list and manage all connected Google accounts, not only the latest account status
  - keep OAuth tokens, sync checkpoints, mutation queues, task lists, calendars, tasks, and events isolated per account
  - add account badges and per-account filters for task lists, calendars, search, Today, and diagnostics
  - support a merged Today view across Personal + Work while preserving source account identity
  - make create/update flows choose an explicit target account/calendar/list when ambiguity exists
  - verify disconnected/reauth-required accounts do not block healthy accounts
  - add migration tests for existing single-account caches and replay tests for per-account pending mutations

### Tasks and organisation

- Status: `Verify` for Kanban parity; `Partial` for tags background/perf, duplicate resolution hardening, grouped duplicate cleanup undo, board-level subtasks/reorder, task/event template instantiation, and NL quick-add; `Done` for snooze inspector/list/search UX and note-template creation; `Missing` for Areas.
- Verify/finish Kanban parity beyond the current Google-list board if original `KanbanGrouping` behavior is not covered.
- Harden first-class tags beyond current catalog/link/inspector-audit/bulk-reapply implementation:
  - background scheduling for backend auto-tag reapply
  - large-account tag analytics/reapply perf QA
- Add hierarchical Areas:
  - area schema
  - area sort order
  - area colors
  - task-list grouping under areas
  - settings/sidebar UI
- Finish bulk operations where current multi-select is incomplete:
  - reschedule
  - tag/untag QA beyond current bulk tag apply path
  - batched/coalesced mutation entries for reschedule
- Harden duplicate resolution for tasks, events, and notes.
  - Note: duplicate create controls, review/dismiss/open/delete, loaded-data merge flows, domain cleanup, and grouped undo are present.
  - Remaining: stronger mutation compaction and event/note duplicate-resolution QA.
- Finish board-level subtask hierarchy/reorder UX:
  - nested hierarchy display beyond current inspector subtasks
  - move/reorder subtasks safely inside Google Tasks list constraints
  - clear visual hierarchy in task views beyond shared subtask previews
- Finish task/event template instantiation beyond current settings schemas and note-template create flow:
  - `{{today}}`
  - `{{+Nd}}`
  - `{{prompt:Label}}`
  - `{{clipboard}}`
  - task/event creation from templates
- Upgrade NL quick-add with chrono-style date parsing and RRULE inference:
  - parse phrases like `every other Tue 9am`, `next Fri 2-4pm`, and `weekly until Jul 30`
  - convert recurring phrases into the existing `CalendarEventRecurrence` shape
  - preserve matched-token chips and remove parsed text from final title/summary
  - keep deterministic fallbacks for ambiguous dates/times
  - add parser tests for time zones, ranges, recurring weekdays, intervals, end dates, and count limits

### Calendar

- Status: `Partial`; Agenda/Day/Multi-Day/Week/Month and drag-to-create are present.
- Add generic month/week/day agenda popover from cell/day click beyond current overflow popovers.
- Add smart-reschedule:
  - suggest new slots for overdue, conflicted, or unscheduled tasks
  - respect priority, duration, locked schedules, working hours, visible calendars, and existing events
  - dry-run preview before applying changes
  - batch apply with undo and mutation coalescing
  - explain why each slot was chosen
- Harden recurring-event edit scope:
  - Google-backed occurrence edits/deletes are implemented.
  - Locally materialized future-series split is implemented.
  - Remaining: Google-expanded future-series writes when only an instance is cached, clearer unsupported-state copy, and live Google smoke.
- Finish visual RRULE editor depth beyond current frequency/interval/weekday/end/count/readable-summary controls:
  - month rules and never-ending rule polish
  - raw RRULE preview
  - validation for unsupported Google/RFC combinations
  - round-trip tests against current recurrence sync code
- Add attendee management depth beyond raw guest emails:
  - RSVP/status display
  - invitations
  - attendee validation/errors
- Add Google Meet/Hangouts attach on event create if current conference support is read-only.
- Add event visibility/transparency UI:
  - busy/free
  - public/private/default
- Expand custom reminders beyond one simple reminder field if needed.

### Today and review surfaces

- Status: `Verify`; CLI/MCP `today` exists, renderer coverage still needs feature-specific audit.
- Verify dedicated Today/Home surface coverage.
- If incomplete, add overdue, due-today, scheduled, next-up, upcoming events, and sidebar-filter-aware sections.
- Add forecast/review summary builders if still missing from original parity.

## 3. Linked markdown and knowledge graph

- Status: `Partial`; task-backed note link parsing/broken-link tests exist, universal entity graph/backlinks are still missing.
- Add shared wikilink parser for every markdown surface:
  - `[[note:...]]`
  - `[[task:...]]`
  - `[[event:...]]`
  - list/calendar links
  - aliases where needed
- Render clickable wikilinks in note bodies, task notes, event descriptions, and list metadata.
- Add read-only transclusion/live embeds:
  - `![[note:...]]`
  - `![[task:#id]]`
  - event/list/calendar embeds if useful
  - cycle and depth limits
  - loading/error/broken-target states
- Add universal entity-link graph:
  - `src_kind`
  - `src_id`
  - `dst_kind`
  - `dst_id`
  - `link_type`
  - source field/surface metadata where useful
- Re-index links after note/task/event/list/calendar edits and Google read sync.
- Expose graph-backed backlinks and outgoing links for every primitive.
- Make broken links visible and repairable for every primitive, not just notes.

## 4. Search, filters, and command surfaces

- Status: `Partial`; local search, MCP/CLI search, advanced parser-backed operators, boolean DSL, saved-search settings, pinned filters, local semantic/hybrid search, local LLM provider hooks, and chat surfaces exist.
- Harden custom-filter DSL UX beyond current parser/operator coverage:
  - boolean explain/validation polish
  - relative dates
  - saved-query UX polish
  - validation and explain output
- Add local semantic search layered on existing search:
  - Current: deterministic local hash embeddings are stored in `local_semantic_embeddings` for tasks/events/notes, semantic/hybrid modes are exposed through IPC/search, and focused SQLite tests cover indexing/search diagnostics.
  - Remaining production path: replace deterministic hash embeddings with a packaged model/vector path after evaluating `sqlite-vec` vs SQLite `Vec1`
  - use a worker-backed embedding path, starting with `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` / `@huggingface/transformers` if packaging is acceptable
  - store production embeddings with entity kind/id, source text hash, model id, and generated-at metadata
  - extend embedding coverage to lists and calendars
  - background embedding/index refresh after edits and sync
  - tune hybrid ranking with current FTS/DSL results
  - local/private model and no remote embedding calls by default
  - model download/cache controls, rebuild controls, and disabled-state UI when the model or vector extension is unavailable
  - diagnostics for stale/missing embeddings
- Add opt-in local LLM provider hook:
  - Current: user-configured Ollama and OpenAI-compatible endpoints exist, default disabled, with remote URLs blocked unless explicitly enabled.
  - Remaining: summarize long notes, suggest task breakdowns, draft event agendas, and explain plans through existing MCP read/write tools
  - route writes through dry-run previews and confirmation IDs; no silent task/event/note mutations
  - redact tokens/secrets, enforce context budgets, timeouts, cancellation, rate limits, and audit logs
  - show model/provider health, last error, and privacy status in Settings/Diagnostics
- Add in-app conversational planning sidebar:
  - Current: a local chat panel stores local chat history and answers with local search context plus optional provider calls.
  - Remaining: act as an MCP client to HCB's local tools/resources/prompts and a user-configured model
  - answer richer planning questions like "what should I do next?" using Today/search/calendar/task context
  - surface proposed writes through the Pending agent action tray
  - keep chat history local, exportable, clearable, and excluded from remote services by default
  - include prompt-injection guardrails for note/event/task content used as context
- Finish pinned filters in the menu-bar popover with count badges if sidebar/command-palette coverage is not enough.
- Split quick switcher and quick-add mental model if current command palette remains one surface:
  - `Cmd+O` for go/open
  - `Shift+Cmd+P` for do/action
  - command IDs remain discoverable
- Add leader-key chord bindings with conflict detection.
- Add which-key HUD overlay for chord discovery.

## 5. User customisation layer

- Status: `Partial` for built-in appearance/theme, event color overrides, and in-app hotkeys; `Missing` for user CSS snippets, app-data JSON config/keymaps, and sandboxed extensions.

### CSS tokens and snippets

- Document and publicly stabilize existing CSS custom properties for snippet authors.
- Add user snippets directory under app data, e.g. `<userData>/snippets/*.css`.
- Add snippet loader with enable/disable/reload/error handling.
- Add Settings UI for snippets:
  - detected snippets
  - enable/disable
  - load errors
  - open snippets folder
  - reset defaults
- Add `docs/customization/theming.md` with public tokens, scoping rules, stability guarantees, and sample snippets.
- Add tests for token presence, snippet loading, snippet errors, and CSP regression.

### JSON config and keymaps

- Note: built-in keybinding settings and conflict detection exist; this item is specifically external app-data JSON config/keymap support.
- Add app-data `settings.json` for layout, density, panel visibility/order, default view, sidebar contents, and safe feature toggles.
- Add app-data `keymap.json`:
  - keys
  - command id
  - `when` predicate
- Add JSON Schemas under `docs/customization/schemas/`.
- Add a typed settings store with defaults, deep merge, validation errors, and change events.
- Add Settings UI for opening/resetting config files and surfacing validation errors.
- Parse `when` predicates without `eval` or `new Function`.
- Add tests for schemas, merge precedence, predicate parser, and keybinding conflicts.

### Sandboxed extensions

- Add user extension directory: `<userData>/extensions/<id>/{manifest.json,main.js}`.
- Run extension views as sandboxed renderer iframes or equivalent isolated web contents with no Node/Electron/fs/net/child_process access.
- Expose only a versioned, capability-gated bridge.
- Initial host API:
  - `registerCommand`
  - `onEvent`
  - `contributeView`
  - `getSetting` for whitelisted keys
- Make plugin UI communicate only through a reduced preload/host bridge with schema validation, rate limits, and explicit capability grants.
- Block remote code loading by default; require local packaged extension files and a strict extension CSP.
- Add manifest capabilities and first-load user consent.
- Add per-extension enable/disable, logs, requested capabilities, and safe mode.
- Add sandbox escape tests, bridge contract tests, capability tests, and safe-mode tests.
- Add `docs/customization/extensions.md` with security model and sample extension.

## 6. Data, import/export, and local files

- Status: `Partial`; portable `.hcbexport` export/preview/import now writes manifest/state/Attachments, deterministic table JSON, selected list/calendar/future filters, SHA-256 checks, bundled attachment copies, skipped pointer reporting, destructive import preview, pre-import backup, and attachment relinking.
- Harden portable `.hcbexport` workflow:
  - manual migration QA on a real profile copy
  - decide only if a future `.hcb2export` alias/version is needed
- Finish user-facing local file attachments for notes, tasks, and events beyond portable pointer scan/export/import backend:
  - add/paste/drop/picker UI where missing
  - open/download/copy actions
  - visible missing/corrupt pointer states outside repair settings
- Add ICS calendar import and watched ICS subscriptions:
  - import local `.ics` files into cached calendar writes or a read-only local calendar source
  - subscribe to user-configured `https://` / `webcal://` ICS URLs with refresh intervals and ETag/Last-Modified caching where available
  - parse RFC 5545 `VEVENT`, `RRULE`, `RDATE`, `EXDATE`, time zones, all-day events, cancellations, and updates
  - keep subscribed calendars read-only unless explicitly copied into HCB/Google
  - show refresh status, parse errors, stale feeds, and last successful sync in Settings/Diagnostics
  - avoid sending subscribed ICS data to Google unless the user explicitly imports/copies it
- Add local export/report flows that are still missing after current print support.

## 7. Security, native Mac integration, and release polish

- Status: `Partial`; base macOS-native shell, diagnostics, History/Sync Issues, MCP loopback/resources/prompts, Keychain-backed secrets, sync modes, retention settings, dock badge code path, updater metadata/docs, local backups, and notifications scaffolding exist, but the items below still need product hardening.
- Verify/finish local cache encryption as an opt-in, data-safety-gated feature:
  - keep unencrypted SQLite as the default until encrypted-cache migration is proven by tests and manual recovery drills
  - evaluate `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` against current Electron/Node/macOS packaging, maintenance, license, prebuild, and deprecation risk
  - prefer a SQLCipher-compatible cipher mode only if compatibility and long-term support are acceptable
  - store a random database key in macOS Keychain through the existing secret-store layer; keep key material outside SQLite and out of renderer IPC
  - do not encrypt a plaintext database in place; create a backup, checkpoint WAL, copy/export into a new encrypted database, verify, then atomically swap
  - run `PRAGMA integrity_check`, schema checks, row-count/hash checks, and app-level read smoke checks before deleting or archiving the plaintext original
  - retain rollback copies until the encrypted DB has opened successfully across restart and sync replay
  - support explicit decrypt/export recovery while the user still has Keychain access
  - document key-loss behavior clearly: encrypted cache is unrecoverable without the stored key, but Google source data can be re-synced after reconnect
  - do not ship the settings toggle until migration, downgrade, backup restore, corrupt-key, missing-Keychain, and interrupted-write tests pass
- Past-task cleanup settings:
  - Status: `Partial`; completed-task retention exists, but overdue cleanup behavior still needs product/implementation audit.
- Verify/finish in-app GitHub Releases update checker:
  - version compare
  - latest release state
  - recoverable network errors
  - manual download prompt
  - no silent insecure update
- Add native discovery helper for Spotlight, Raycast, and Alfred.
  - tiny Swift/ObjC helper packaged with the Electron app
  - index sanitized task/event/note/list titles into private on-device CoreSpotlight
  - route Spotlight results back through `hcb://task/...`, `hcb://event/...`, `hcb://note/...`, and `hcb://today`
  - keep bodies out of Spotlight by default; expose body indexing only behind an explicit privacy setting
  - add reindex/repair controls and diagnostics
  - add Raycast support via extension or script commands for search, today, quick capture, and open result
  - add Alfred workflow support with script filters/actions for search, today, quick capture, and open result
  - route Raycast/Alfred actions through `hcb://`, the CLI, or authenticated loopback MCP without exposing bearer tokens
- Add App Intents / Shortcuts helper.
  - expose App Shortcuts for Open Today, Quick Capture, What's Next, create task, create event, open task/event/note, and run saved search
  - route helper actions back into Electron through deep links, the CLI, MCP tools, or a hardened local IPC bridge
  - keep helper permissions narrow and avoid direct Google OAuth token access
- Add macOS Share Extension for quick capture.
  - accept selected text and URLs from host apps
  - create task or note drafts
  - prefer App Group drop file / queue if HCB is not running
  - optionally call authenticated loopback MCP only when server is enabled and reachable
  - sanitize shared input and surface failures without leaking source app data
- Add rich notification actions.
  - actions: Snooze 10m, Complete, Open
  - wire Snooze to `local_snooze_until`
  - wire Complete through existing task/event complete handlers and pending mutation queue
  - keep destructive actions confirmable where needed
  - support background handling when the window is closed
- Finish notification UX:
  - permission primer separate from onboarding if still absent
  - configurable lead times
  - task due-date notification defaults
  - event notification defaults
  - 64-notification cap behavior
  - reschedule diagnostics
- Expand agent-native MCP, CLI, and local automation surface:
  - Current: base MCP/CLI read/write CRUD, sync, queue, undo/redo, convert tools, `hcb_brief`, `hcb tail`, `hcb plan`, durable pending action storage, floating approval tray, and loopback webhook subscriptions are present.
  - Current webhook coverage: localhost/127.0.0.1/::1 validation, HMAC signatures, private-body redaction by default, task created/completed emits, and sync completed emits.
  - Remaining: event-starting and mutation-failed emit sources, webhook retry/backoff/rate-limit hardening, richer prompt coverage for day planning/inbox triage/standups/reschedule/duplicate review, and external MCP client QA.
  - keep all agent/CLI/webhook output redacted and context-budgeted
  - add/finish tests for webhook delivery retry paths, event-starting/mutation-failed emits, richer prompts, and external MCP client behavior
- Audit MCP tool catalogue parity with original:
  - Status: `Partial`; current tool registry is broad and tested, but original parity must be checked explicitly before closing this.
  - exact tool names
  - aliases such as `hcb_today`, `hcb_week`, `hcb_search`, `hcb_create_task`
  - per-tool dry-run / confirm-write / allow-write modes
  - docs and tests

## 8. Performance, tests, and docs

- Add low-power-mode and constrained-network detection feeding sync backoff multipliers.
- Add large-account regression coverage:
  - 15k-event target
  - prepared event indexes/snapshots where still missing
  - startup and calendar navigation timings
- Maintain security posture:
  - no credential leaks
  - no weakened CSP
  - no remote code loading
  - no unsafe SQL/string query construction
  - no permission bypass
- Preserve Google Tasks/Calendar sync semantics and offline replay.
- Add focused tests for:
  - chrono-style NL parser/RRULE inference
  - migrations for multi-account, encryption, and external config
  - reducers/stores
  - IPC contracts
  - custom-filter DSL polish
  - production semantic model/vector extension path

## 9. Ports last

Run only after Mac v1 work above is stable. Do not run Linux and Windows first-pass port work in parallel.

### Cross-platform adapter audit

- Identify Mac-only assumptions in paths, credentials, tray, menu, shortcuts, notifications, protocol, autostart, updater, diagnostics, OAuth, MCP, packaging, and tests.
- Refine shared adapter interfaces for platform capabilities.
- Expose capability-report DTOs through preload/settings where appropriate.
- Add adapter contract tests runnable without Linux or Windows.
- Keep platform-specific logic out of renderer components.
- Do not claim non-Mac support.

### Linux technical preview

- Implement Linux adapter implementations or stubs for:
  - app paths
  - Secret Service/libsecret credentials
  - tray/status area
  - global shortcuts
  - notifications
  - custom protocol
  - autostart
  - updater metadata
  - external open behavior
  - diagnostics
- Add capability detection for Secret Service, tray support, X11 vs Wayland, portal shortcuts, notifications, and protocol status.
- Add Linux settings/diagnostics status surfaces.
- Add Linux adapter tests, using mocks where not running on Linux.
- Package AppImage first.
- Add desktop metadata, icons, categories, keywords, and StartupWMClass.
- Add Linux install/run/uninstall docs, manual QA checklist, and performance smoke instructions.
- Do not enable plaintext credential fallback.
- Do not claim universal Linux parity.

### Windows technical preview

- Implement Windows adapter implementations or stubs for:
  - app paths
  - credential storage
  - tray
  - global shortcuts
  - notifications
  - custom protocol
  - autostart
  - updater metadata
  - external open behavior
  - diagnostics
- Add stable AppUserModelID/app identity wiring early in startup.
- Add Windows settings/diagnostics status surfaces for tray, shortcuts, notifications, protocol, updater, signing, and SmartScreen where known.
- Add Windows adapter tests, using mocks where not running on Windows.
- Package NSIS first.
- Add executable name, installer display name, Start Menu shortcut, protocol registration, and icon metadata.
- Add signing plan docs:
  - unsigned internal preview
  - Microsoft Store MSIX option
  - Azure Artifact Signing / Trusted Signing
  - OV certificate
  - self-signed dev-only behavior
- Add Windows install/run/uninstall docs, manual QA checklist, and performance smoke instructions.
- Do not claim public Windows readiness without signing and runtime QA.
- Do not commit certificates, passwords, tokens, or signing secrets.

### Cross-platform release hardening

- Audit adapters for duplicated logic, drift, unsafe fallbacks, and renderer platform branching.
- Verify capability reports are consistent in Settings and Diagnostics.
- Verify install/update/uninstall docs match actual package behavior.
- Verify performance smoke reports exist or are explicitly blocked per platform.
- Verify manual QA checklists exist for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Update roadmap/docs to distinguish supported, technical preview, and unsupported features by platform.
- Do not add new platform scope.
- Do not weaken security, credential storage, or MCP local-only guarantees to simplify a port.
