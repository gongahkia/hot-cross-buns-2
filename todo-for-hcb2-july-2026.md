# TODO for HCB2 - July 2026

Consolidated from:

- `stuff-missing-from-hcb2-to-add-july-2026.md`
- `prompts-to-run-july-2026-to-port-to-diff-devices.md`
- `proposed-optimisations-for-hcb2-july-2026.md`

Open tasks only. Ports stay last.

Last static repo audit for this file: 2026-06-09.

Audit limits: static repo/source/test evidence only. No live Google API, external MCP client, packaged-app, or manual UI QA was performed.

Status key:

- `Partial`: implemented enough to use, but named hardening/depth remains.
- `Missing`: no static repo evidence found during this audit.
- `Verify`: adjacent code exists, but a feature-specific audit is needed before code.
- `Deferred`: intentionally parked.

## Recommended next implementation order

1. First-class tags:
   - Status: `Partial`.
   - Open: large-account tag analytics perf QA; manual real-profile auto-tag reapply smoke.
2. Recurrence correctness:
   - Status: `Partial`.
   - Open: live Google smoke for future-series and missing-master recurrence cases.
3. Boolean/custom search, semantic search, and planning chat:
   - Status: `Partial`.
   - Open: production transformer/vector-extension path, embedding worker/model controls, broader embedding coverage, richer provider health/diagnostics, and MCP-backed action proposals.
4. Duplicate merge/coalesced cleanup:
   - Status: `Partial`.
   - Open: manual real-profile duplicate cleanup smoke for tasks, events, and notes.
5. Portable export/import verification:
   - Status: `Partial`.
   - Open: manual migration QA on a real profile copy.
6. Agent-native MCP/CLI v2:
   - Status: `Partial`.
   - Open: webhook retry/rate-limit hardening, event-starting/mutation-failed emit sources, external MCP client QA, deeper approval-tray UI QA.
7. Release hardening:
   - Open: live Google smoke, external MCP client QA, rich notification actions, updater, packaging/signing checks.

## 0. Planning gate

- Re-audit current repo and `../hot-cross-buns` before any implementation slice.
- For the selected slice, classify each item as `Present`, `Partial`, `Missing`, or `Deferred-with-reason` before code.
- Inspect at minimum:
  - `src/main/mcp/toolRegistry.ts`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/inspectors/TaskInspectorBody.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/screens/settings/AdvancedSettingsTab.tsx`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/screens/calendar/CalendarEventForm.tsx`
  - `src/main/sync/readSyncRepository/recurrence.ts`
  - `src/main/native/notificationScheduling.ts`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/viewModelSource/loader.ts`
  - `src/renderer/src/features/core/viewModelSource/provider.tsx`
- Confirm priorities, acceptable slice size, UX expectations, migration tolerance, security expectations, platform scope, test depth, and explicit deferrals before broad code.
- Produce a dependency-aware implementation plan with migrations, UI surfaces, IPC/contracts, tests, manual QA, and rollback/data-safety notes.
- Keep each slice scoped; update this todo when an item is implemented, verified present, or deferred.

## 1. Accounts and sync scope

- Status: `Partial`.
- Add per-account filters for search and diagnostics.
- Make create/update flows choose an explicit target account/calendar/list when ambiguity remains after destination selection.
- Verify disconnected/reauth-required accounts do not block healthy accounts.
- Add/expand migration tests for existing single-account caches and replay tests for per-account pending mutations where the selected implementation touches them.
- Run live multi-account QA.

## 2. Tasks and organisation

- Status: `Verify` for Kanban parity; `Partial` for tags background/perf and duplicate resolution hardening.
- Verify/finish Kanban parity beyond the current Google-list board if original `KanbanGrouping` behavior is not covered.
- Run large-account tag analytics perf QA.
- Run manual real-profile auto-tag reapply smoke.
- Finish bulk tag/untag QA beyond the current bulk tag apply path.
- Add batched/coalesced mutation-entry perf QA for large bulk edits.
- Run manual real-profile duplicate cleanup smoke for tasks, events, and notes.
- Harden Quick Add parser edge cases:
  - time zones
  - broader ambiguous date/time QA
  - count-limit and RRULE round-trip QA beyond current focused parser tests

## 3. Calendar

- Status: `Partial`.
- Harden recurring-event edit scope:
  - live Google smoke for future-series and missing-master recurrence cases
- Deferred: attendee invitation/status editing beyond guest email writes. RSVP/status metadata is read/displayed; local writes avoid inventing attendee response state.

## 4. Linked markdown and knowledge graph

- Status: `Partial`; task-backed note link parsing/broken-link tests exist, universal entity graph/backlinks are still missing.
- Add shared wikilink parser for every markdown surface:
  - `[[note:...]]`
  - `[[task:...]]`
  - `[[event:...]]`
  - list/calendar links
  - aliases where needed
- Render clickable wikilinks in note bodies, task notes, event descriptions, and list metadata.
- Add read-only transclusion/live embeds:
  - `![[note:...]]`
  - `![[task:#id]]`
  - event/list/calendar embeds if useful
  - cycle and depth limits
  - loading/error/broken-target states
- Add universal entity-link graph:
  - `src_kind`
  - `src_id`
  - `dst_kind`
  - `dst_id`
  - `link_type`
  - source field/surface metadata where useful
- Re-index links after note/task/event/list/calendar edits and Google read sync.
- Expose graph-backed backlinks and outgoing links for every primitive.
- Make broken links visible and repairable for every primitive, not just notes.

## 5. Search, filters, and command surfaces

- Status: `Partial`.
- Harden custom-filter DSL UX:
  - boolean explain/validation polish
  - relative dates
  - saved-query UX polish
  - validation and explain output
- Add production local semantic search path:
  - replace deterministic hash embeddings with a packaged model/vector path after evaluating `sqlite-vec` vs SQLite `Vec1`
  - use a worker-backed embedding path, starting with `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` / `@huggingface/transformers` if packaging is acceptable
  - store production embeddings with entity kind/id, source text hash, model id, and generated-at metadata
  - extend embedding coverage to lists and calendars
  - background embedding/index refresh after edits and sync
  - tune hybrid ranking with current FTS/DSL results
  - local/private model and no remote embedding calls by default
  - model download/cache controls, rebuild controls, and disabled-state UI when the model or vector extension is unavailable
  - diagnostics for stale/missing embeddings
- Harden opt-in local LLM provider hook:
  - summarize long notes
  - suggest task breakdowns
  - draft event agendas
  - explain plans through existing MCP read/write tools
  - route writes through dry-run previews and confirmation IDs
  - redact tokens/secrets
  - enforce context budgets, timeouts, cancellation, rate limits, and audit logs
  - show model/provider health, last error, and privacy status in Settings/Diagnostics
- Harden in-app conversational planning sidebar:
  - act as an MCP client to local tools/resources/prompts and a user-configured model
  - answer richer planning questions like "what should I do next?" using Today/search/calendar/task context
  - surface proposed writes through the Pending agent action tray
  - keep chat history local, exportable, clearable, and excluded from remote services by default
  - include prompt-injection guardrails for note/event/task content used as context
- Finish pinned filters in the menu-bar popover with count badges if sidebar/command-palette coverage is not enough.
- Split quick switcher and quick-add mental model if current command palette remains one surface:
  - `Cmd+O` for go/open
  - `Shift+Cmd+P` for do/action
  - command IDs remain discoverable
- Add leader-key chord bindings with conflict detection.
- Add which-key HUD overlay for chord discovery.

## 6. User customisation layer

- Status: `Partial` for built-in appearance/theme, event color overrides, and in-app hotkeys; `Missing` for user CSS snippets, app-data JSON config/keymaps, and sandboxed extensions.

### CSS tokens and snippets

- Document and publicly stabilize existing CSS custom properties for snippet authors.
- Add user snippets directory under app data, e.g. `<userData>/snippets/*.css`.
- Add snippet loader with enable/disable/reload/error handling.
- Add Settings UI for snippets:
  - detected snippets
  - enable/disable
  - load errors
  - open snippets folder
  - reset defaults
- Add `docs/customization/theming.md` with public tokens, scoping rules, stability guarantees, and sample snippets.
- Add tests for token presence, snippet loading, snippet errors, and CSP regression.

### JSON config and keymaps

- Note: built-in keybinding settings and conflict detection exist; this item is specifically external app-data JSON config/keymap support.
- Add app-data `settings.json` for layout, density, panel visibility/order, default view, sidebar contents, and safe feature toggles.
- Add app-data `keymap.json`:
  - keys
  - command id
  - `when` predicate
- Add JSON Schemas under `docs/customization/schemas/`.
- Add a typed settings store with defaults, deep merge, validation errors, and change events.
- Add Settings UI for opening/resetting config files and surfacing validation errors.
- Parse `when` predicates without `eval` or `new Function`.
- Add tests for schemas, merge precedence, predicate parser, and keybinding conflicts.

### Sandboxed extensions

- Add user extension directory: `<userData>/extensions/<id>/{manifest.json,main.js}`.
- Run extension views as sandboxed renderer iframes or equivalent isolated web contents with no Node/Electron/fs/net/child_process access.
- Expose only a versioned, capability-gated bridge.
- Initial host API:
  - `registerCommand`
  - `onEvent`
  - `contributeView`
  - `getSetting` for whitelisted keys
- Make plugin UI communicate only through a reduced preload/host bridge with schema validation, rate limits, and explicit capability grants.
- Block remote code loading by default; require local packaged extension files and a strict extension CSP.
- Add manifest capabilities and first-load user consent.
- Add per-extension enable/disable, logs, requested capabilities, and safe mode.
- Add sandbox escape tests, bridge contract tests, capability tests, and safe-mode tests.
- Add `docs/customization/extensions.md` with security model and sample extension.

## 7. Data, import/export, and local files

- Status: `Partial`.
- Harden portable `.hcbexport` workflow:
  - manual migration QA on a real profile copy
  - decide only if a future `.hcb2export` alias/version is needed
- Finish user-facing local file attachments for notes, tasks, and events beyond portable pointer scan/export/import backend:
  - add/paste/drop/picker UI where missing
  - open/download/copy actions
  - visible missing/corrupt pointer states outside repair settings
- Add ICS calendar import and watched ICS subscriptions:
  - import local `.ics` files into cached calendar writes or a read-only local calendar source
  - subscribe to user-configured `https://` / `webcal://` ICS URLs with refresh intervals and ETag/Last-Modified caching where available
  - parse RFC 5545 `VEVENT`, `RRULE`, `RDATE`, `EXDATE`, time zones, all-day events, cancellations, and updates
  - keep subscribed calendars read-only unless explicitly copied into HCB/Google
  - show refresh status, parse errors, stale feeds, and last successful sync in Settings/Diagnostics
  - avoid sending subscribed ICS data to Google unless the user explicitly imports/copies it
- Add local export/report flows that are still missing after current print support.

## 8. Security, native Mac integration, and release polish

- Status: `Partial`.
- Verify/finish local cache encryption as an opt-in, data-safety-gated feature:
  - keep unencrypted SQLite as the default until encrypted-cache migration is proven by tests and manual recovery drills
  - evaluate `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` against current Electron/Node/macOS packaging, maintenance, license, prebuild, and deprecation risk
  - prefer a SQLCipher-compatible cipher mode only if compatibility and long-term support are acceptable
  - store a random database key in macOS Keychain through the existing secret-store layer; keep key material outside SQLite and out of renderer IPC
  - do not encrypt a plaintext database in place; create a backup, checkpoint WAL, copy/export into a new encrypted database, verify, then atomically swap
  - run `PRAGMA integrity_check`, schema checks, row-count/hash checks, and app-level read smoke checks before deleting or archiving the plaintext original
  - retain rollback copies until the encrypted DB has opened successfully across restart and sync replay
  - support explicit decrypt/export recovery while the user still has Keychain access
  - document key-loss behavior clearly: encrypted cache is unrecoverable without the stored key, but Google source data can be re-synced after reconnect
  - do not ship the settings toggle until migration, downgrade, backup restore, corrupt-key, missing-Keychain, and interrupted-write tests pass
- Audit overdue cleanup behavior against completed-task retention.
- Verify/finish in-app GitHub Releases update checker:
  - version compare
  - latest release state
  - recoverable network errors
  - manual download prompt
  - no silent insecure update
- Add native discovery helper for Spotlight, Raycast, and Alfred:
  - tiny Swift/ObjC helper packaged with the Electron app
  - index sanitized task/event/note/list titles into private on-device CoreSpotlight
  - route Spotlight results back through `hcb://task/...`, `hcb://event/...`, `hcb://note/...`, and `hcb://today`
  - keep bodies out of Spotlight by default; expose body indexing only behind an explicit privacy setting
  - add reindex/repair controls and diagnostics
  - add Raycast support via extension or script commands for search, today, quick capture, and open result
  - add Alfred workflow support with script filters/actions for search, today, quick capture, and open result
  - route Raycast/Alfred actions through `hcb://`, the CLI, or authenticated loopback MCP without exposing bearer tokens
- Add App Intents / Shortcuts helper:
  - expose App Shortcuts for Open Today, Quick Capture, What's Next, create task, create event, open task/event/note, and run saved search
  - route helper actions back into Electron through deep links, the CLI, MCP tools, or a hardened local IPC bridge
  - keep helper permissions narrow and avoid direct Google OAuth token access
- Add macOS Share Extension for quick capture:
  - accept selected text and URLs from host apps
  - create task or note drafts
  - prefer App Group drop file / queue if HCB is not running
  - optionally call authenticated loopback MCP only when server is enabled and reachable
  - sanitize shared input and surface failures without leaking source app data
- Add rich notification actions:
  - Snooze 10m
  - Complete
  - Open
  - wire Snooze to `local_snooze_until`
  - wire Complete through existing task/event complete handlers and pending mutation queue
  - keep destructive actions confirmable where needed
  - support background handling when the window is closed
- Finish notification UX:
  - permission primer separate from onboarding if still absent
  - configurable lead times
  - task due-date notification defaults
  - event notification defaults
  - 64-notification cap behavior
  - reschedule diagnostics
- Expand agent-native MCP, CLI, and local automation surface:
  - event-starting and mutation-failed emit sources
  - webhook retry/backoff/rate-limit hardening
  - richer prompt coverage for day planning/inbox triage/standups/reschedule/duplicate review
  - external MCP client QA
  - redacted/context-budgeted output
  - tests for webhook delivery retry paths, event-starting/mutation-failed emits, richer prompts, and external MCP client behavior
- Audit MCP tool catalogue parity with original:
  - exact tool names
  - aliases
  - per-tool dry-run / confirm-write / allow-write modes
  - docs and tests

## 9. Performance, tests, and docs

- Add low-power-mode and constrained-network detection feeding sync backoff multipliers.
- Add large-account regression coverage:
  - 15k-event target
  - prepared event indexes/snapshots where still missing
  - startup and calendar navigation timings

  - Share Extension
  - rich notification actions
  - pending agent action tray
  - `hcb tail` and `hcb plan`
  - loopback webhook delivery/retry
  - share/intent flows where locally testable
- Each completed slice must report:
  - implemented items
  - deferred items with approved reason
  - commands run and results
  - manual QA evidence
  - migrations/data-safety notes
  - remaining risk
